PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION
</h2>

<p>Since the publication of the first edition of this
book eleven years have elapsed, years packed full of
varied and interesting experiences.</p>

<p>During that time it has been the pleasant fortune
of the author to conduct classes, especially summer
classes, in the science and art of pottery production.
These have been occasions of meeting many fine and
noble personalities whom to know is a liberal education.
As one of the consequences of these experiences
the book has been revised and some new chapters have
been written. Especial acknowledgments are due and
are gratefully made to Elsie Binns for the chapter
on Clay-Working for Children and to Maude Robinson
for that on Alkaline Glazes.</p>

PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION
</h2>

<p>This Book is the outcome of an experience extending
over a period of thirty-six years. Twenty years
ago it would have been impossible, for the science of
ceramics was not then born. Ten years ago it would
have been wasted for the Artist-potter in America had
not arrived, but now the individual workers are many
and the science is well established.</p>

<p>Written teaching must be imperfect, but I have endeavored
to set down the exact methods by which my
students are taught, in the hope that those who cannot
secure personal instruction may read and understand.</p>

<p>As far as possible didactic statements have been
avoided and the attempt has been made to lead every
student to experiment and to think for himself. In
other words, I have tried to erect sign-posts and occasional
warnings rather than to remove all obstacles
from the road.</p>

<h2 id='INTRODUCTION'>
INTRODUCTION<br />
<span class='exp'>The Present Need</span>
</h2>

<p>Many times it has been proven, in the history
of the world, that it is not possible to force
a reform or a novelty upon an unwilling people.
Such things are organic. In order to live they must
grow and in order to grow must live. No attempt
will be made, therefore, in these pages to foster an
idea or propound a thought which may exist only in
the predilection of the author.</p>

<p>The trend of the present demand, a persistent
growth of several years, is towards a personal and
individual expression in the crafts or industrial arts.
This tendency is the natural swing of the pendulum
from the machine-made product of the manufactory
which in its turn was the inevitable result of mechanical
invention.</p>

<p>When the artisan was an artist and the designer a
craftsman, there was but a limited production of industrial
art. The articles made were expensive and
for the wealthy alone. The common utensils necessary
to the household were made on the farm and
were of the rudest possible character. But with the
gradual development of machinery there came an
abandonment of rural activities, a flocking to the city,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
manufacturing on a large scale, lower prices, and a
huge output. This has, of course, taken many years
to develop, but the utmost limit of the swing has been
reached and the question is "What next?" Will the
factory cease its labors? Will output decrease in bulk
and improve in quality? Will there ever, in a word,
be a return to medieval conditions? Not only may all
these questions be answered in the negative but it
may be stated with all sincerity that there is no need
for any other answer.</p>

<p>What then, are not manufactured products as now
put forth a menace to the art life of the nation? Are
not the people being educated in the use of and belief
in machine-made ornament and meretricious display?
Perhaps so, but no good purpose will be served
by a ruthless condemnation of these things. Art appreciation
is a most subtle thing and no one may
dictate to his neighbor as to what he should or should
not admire. It took time for the public to understand
and patronize the product of the machine even though
the price was favorable. It will take time for an
appreciation of craftsmanship to influence the land
but this consummation will most assuredly come.</p>

<p>On the one hand there is the manufactory, teeming
with "hands," riotous with wheels, turning out its
wares by the thousand and supplying the demand of
the many; on the other, there is the artist-artisan.
He labors at his bench in sincere devotion to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
chosen vocation. His work is laborious and exacting,
he can make but a few things and for them he must
ask a price relatively high. Both these conditions are
necessary. The craftsman cannot supply the need of
the people and the manufacturer has no time or
thought for disinterested production. Herein lies the
need and here is the mission of the individual worker.</p>

<p>In every age it is given to some to discern more
than the multitude and it is theirs to teach. The
people are anxious to learn, are eager to be led. What
they demand will be manufactured and so by the irresistible
lever of public opinion the man at the bench,
if he be true to himself and to his craft, may move
the millionaire manufacturer to make wares which, if
not truly artistic, shall at least be inoffensive. Such a
mission is not to be accomplished without suffering.
The man who essays to attack a giant must be sure
both of his ground and of his personal condition.
He who would establish his craft in the knowledge and
affection of men must possess enthusiasm, skill, discrimination
and infinite patience.</p>

<p>It is not enough to discern the good, the hand must
follow the brain with diligent care. Furthermore, it
is not enough to be able to make things well, one
must also make them good and know it. The artist-artisan
must have courage to destroy that which is
below standard, and self-denial to resist the temptation
to sell an unworthy product.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span></p>

<p>The country needs craftsmen of this type and for
them there is an important work. For such, if they
elect to join the ranks of the potters, these words are
written and in the hope that some may be stimulated,
encouraged, guided and helped the counsel of a fellow
craftsman is offered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_I'>
CHAPTER I<br />
<span class='exp'>Applied Art</span>
</h2>

<p>It is not intended, in these lines, to consider what
are generally termed the Fine Arts, painting and
sculpture. These are perfectly competent to take care
of themselves and, indeed, the author can make no
claim to an ability to discuss them. In the field of
applied art, however, there are certain principles to
be observed, principles, moreover, which are frequently
lost sight of because of the lamentable separation
of the functions of the artist and artificer.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to draw the line between
art and manufacture. For example, a wall paper,
designed with skill and executed by machinery in actual
reproduction of the work of the designer; is it
a work of art or is it a product of the factory? It
is both. Primarily a work of art is the product of the
artist's own hand. It reveals his individuality. It is
the language in which he expresses himself to his audience.
It is the note of his voice. Such a work may
or may not appeal to a large section of the public.
This will always be so. An artist, be he poet, musician,
painter or craftsman, is one who can see more
than others. What he sees he endeavors to express
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
but it is inevitable that he be sometimes misunderstood.
Hence it the more necessary that his message be
delivered at first hand. To look upon a replica of the
work of an artist is like reading a sermon or an oration
from a printed page. One may gather much of
the teaching but the personal note, the tone and
gesture, must be lost.</p>

<p>But there are many who can gather the words
of great men only from books. There are, moreover,
books which have never been spoken and wherein alone
the message is to be found. In like manner there are
works, emanating from the hand of great designers
which can only be made available for the many in
a form of reproduction. The wall paper cited as an
illustration is of this class. Were it not for the printing
press this beautiful design could not have passed
beyond the studio, and while it is a great thing if
a wealthy man can commission a Whistler to decorate
a peacock room, it is an advantage by no means to
be ignored that a well designed wall paper can be
purchased by the piece.</p>

<p>But while this is true of such of the household
goods as cannot be procured except by the medium of
the machine, there are other examples. In the case
of the wall paper the function of the machine is
simply to transfer the proper design to the paper
itself. This has no identity except as a surface. It
is no more to be considered than is a canvas upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
which a picture is painted. But when a chair or a
table is formed out of pieces of lumber uniformly
shaped by one machine, the seat or top put together
by another and the legs or back carved or stamped by
a third, art or individuality is lost because mechanical
construction is involved.</p>

<p>Still more is this the case in the product of the
manufactory of pottery. In commercial practice not
only is a shape designed without regard to decoration
but the same decoration is placed upon several forms,
or a single form is made to suffer as the vehicle for
many decorations. Some of the results may be pleasing,
even beautiful, but it is more by luck than guidance
and no piece produced in this way has any claim
to be classed as a work of art.</p>

<p>On the other hand it may happen that a work of
art, in the sense of individual expression, may not
even be beautiful and one is tempted to ask the reason.
If a work which is a genuine expression of a man's
personality fail to please the senses of those who are
trained in the finer perceptions there must be something
wrong.</p>

<p>If the adverse opinion be at all general amongst
the critics it may be assumed that they are right and
that the worker is wrong.</p>

<p>For example, the form of a flower is not a fit receptacle
for a . It often happens that a
designer, struck with the beauty of, say, a tulip, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
modeled the flower in clay and made it into a candlestick.
Now it is obvious that the more closely the
model simulates the flower the less appropriate it is
for such a purpose. If the model be heavy enough
to be of use it must be far removed from its prototype.
If a conventional design for a candlestick be
adopted the petals of a flower may be shown in
relief upon it but there must always be a solid
foundation to account for the possibility of use.</p>

<p>A favorite form with some designers is a bird's
nest made into a flower holder. In this the same
criticism applies. A bird's nest is always built to let
water escape. Even a mud-lined nest is not impervious
and the idea is obviously inappropriate. It is
important that imitation be avoided and especially the
imitation of material. One often hears the remark
"How beautiful, it looks just like bronze." This, of
course, comes from the casual observer to whom the
skill of the imitation appeals but it cannot be too
strongly insisted upon that to imitate one material in
another is false from every point of view. Nor is
it necessary. Clay is sufficient in itself. There are so
many effects possible in pottery which are not possible
in any other medium that it is entirely superfluous
to seek outlandish texture and color. To be sure,
such things are popular but that does not make them
sound in principle or true in taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>It should not be a purpose of any craft to make
pieces merely as an exhibition of skill. This is done
sometimes by such versatile workers as the Japanese,
but it may be laid down as a law that a production
of the nature of a <i>tour-de-force</i>, an object which
simply excites wonder at the skill of the worker, is
undignified and meretricious. It is akin to the work
of certain painters who delight in painting marble or
velvet so as to exhibit a perfect texture only and is
but one degree removed from the skill of the pavement
artist who with colored chalk draws a lamb
chop or a banana in such a manner that the real
article seems to be lying on the ground at his feet.</p>

<p>The true artist, be he potter or painter, works primarily
for his own satisfaction. It sometimes happens
that a defect, not large enough to be obvious, is a
temptation to concealment. The public will never
know. But the consciousness of the existence of such
a blemish will destroy the pride of achievement which
should accompany every finished piece.</p>

<p>If the worker aims to draw any expression of
opinion from the untrained observer it should be in
the nature of a remark on how easy the work looks.
Art will always conceal effort. Just as the poet or
orator is at his best when he clothes sublime thought
in simple words so the artist or craftsman glorifies
his vocation when he makes use of means which
appear to be within the reach of every observer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the work of the producer there must
be considered the function of the critic. Artists are
commonly impatient of criticism. Tennyson voiced
this sentiment when he wrote of "Irresponsible indolent
reviewers," but the power of the critic is rarer
than the skill of the craftsman. True, there are
critics and critics. There is the man who knows what
he likes and who cannot be persuaded that he likes
what is false, and there is the trained critic who sees
with an educated eye and dissects with an unerring
word. It is not common to find critic and craftsman
in one and the same person and it not infrequently
happens that the persons exercising these functions
are at variance with each other.</p>

<p>But if the critic be correct why is the craftsman
wrong? In this let it be presumed that there is
nothing wrong with his craft as such; that he handles
his tools skilfully and has perfect control over his
material. More than this, however, is necessary. The
first requirement is a sense of form, a term which
includes outline, proportion and structure. Often and
often it is found that a designer depends upon novelty
alone for acceptance. He is not altogether to blame
in this for the great American public will, more often
than not, ask, "Is it new?"</p>

<p>Novelty in itself is no claim to consideration; in
fact, on being shown some product of which it is said
"Nothing like it has ever been seen before," the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
temptation is great to respond, "May its like never
be seen again." Novelty apart, form must possess
proportion, balance and grace. A chair must invite
the sitter, a vase must stand securely, a carpet must
lie flat. The absence of these things may evidence
an individuality on the part of the designer but it is
art at the expense of truth.</p>

<p>The second necessary condition is fitness which
again is expressed in several ways. A porcelain vase
is required to be light, graceful and refined. A piece
of ruder pottery may be no less satisfactory if it
exhibit vigor, strength and solidity. A large pot for
a growing tree is, for these reasons, more appropriate
in gr&egrave;s than in porcelain. Porcelain is translucent
but such a quality is of no advantage in the case of
a flower pot; the strength of a massive body is, however,
demanded by the circumstances of use and hence
the unfitness of the one and the fitness of the other.</p>

<p>Another point of fitness is concerned in the correspondence
between size, form and weight. It often
happens that one takes hold of a piece of pottery and
experiences a shock. The mind unconsciously forms
an estimate of what the weight will be but the piece
does not respond. The effort put forth in accordance
with the appearance of the object either lifts it suddenly
into the air or fails to raise it from the table.
The artist critic takes note of these things. To handle
his wares is a constant pleasure, for one is not continually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
disappointed by unexpected violences. This
correspondence or equilibrium is apart from the use
of a piece of pottery. It is quite as legitimate to
express one's ideas in clay in the presentation of
simple beauty as it is to express them with paint upon
canvas. At the same time there is always a satisfaction
in a vase or flower pot that it can be used
if required. Thus a vase which will not hold water
is technically imperfect and the <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i> of the conscientious
potter.</p>

<p>It is in the harmony of these things that the r&ocirc;le
of the critic is seen to advantage. If the artist be
capable of criticizing his own work he is in a position
to command attention but he must either discipline
himself or be disciplined by others, which, after all,
is the way of the world at large.</p>

CHAPTER II<br />
<span class='exp'>Pottery</span>
</h2>


<p>It must always be an open question how much credit
for artistic feeling can be given to primitive races.
The production of pottery was, at first, the supplying
of a need. Clay offered a medium for the making
of household utensils which were at once fireproof
and impervious. The work does not belong strictly
to the earliest stages of civilization but is a development
of advancing refinement.<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_A' id='FNanchor_A' href='#Footnote_A'>[A]</a></p>

<p>Crude and unprepared clays were used for the most
part but the makers could scarcely have been conscious
of the charming color-play produced by the
burning of a red clay in a smoky fire. The pottery
of the Indians is artistic in the sense of being an
expression of an indigenous art and much of it is
beautiful, though whether the makers possessed any
real appreciation of beauty is open to doubt.</p>

<p>The pottery was exclusively the work of the women.
No wheel was employed but the ware was mainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
constructed by coiling. Long strips of clay were
rolled under the hands and made of uniform size and
these were then coiled in spiral form, the rolls being
welded together with water. After proceeding a certain
height the walls of the growing jar would become
weak under their own weight. The piece would
then be set aside to undergo a partial hardening upon
which the work would be carried forward another
stage. The shape being completed and partially dried,
the maker would work over the whole surface with
stones or simple tools until the marks of the coils
had disappeared and the walls had reached a sufficient
thinness. A great deal of skill was exercised
in accomplishing this.</p>

<p>Many of the Indian forms are transitional. The
basket, the gourd and the bark-made jar suggested
their shapes to the potter; indeed it is sometimes evident
that clay vessels were constructed as linings to
wicker forms, the outer layer of twigs being afterwards
burned off. The firing was performed in the
open flame without any protection, a fact which accounts
for the great irregularity found in quality and
color.</p>

<p>The decorations used by the Indian women were of
the type common to unglazed wares. The clay was
incised or embossed and natural earths were used as
pigments. This accounts in great measure for the fitness
which may be observed in aboriginal decoration.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
There is an absence of artificial coloring, nor is there
any straining after effect, but instead there is shown
a sober strength and a sane expression of values
which would do credit to a modern designer.</p>

<p>America is fortunate in possessing abundant relics
of primitive times but it cannot be doubted that in
other lands similar work was done, making allowance,
of course, for the characteristic variations in
national traits. The potter's craft is of such a nature,
using an omnipresent material and requiring the minimum
of tools, that almost every nation on the globe
has practiced it. In some it has never been developed
beyond the narrow limits of the stone age, in others
it has reached the utmost perfection of cultured skill.</p>

<p>For perfection of quality in crude pottery, no ware
has ever surpassed that of Greece. It is not practicable
here to deal with the numerous branches and
sub-branches of Greek pottery; let it suffice for the
present purpose to speak of only two main groups.
In the first, the background of the decoration was
supplied by the tint of the bare clay; in the second,
this tint afforded the color of the decoration itself,
the background being covered with a black pigment.
To speak briefly these groups are known as black-figured
and red-figured wares.</p>

<p>The wheel was early adopted by the Grecian potters
as a means of producing form and although molds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
were sometimes used, the wheel was, to all intents
and purposes, the sole method of manufacture. Greek
pottery is once fired. Birch classes it as glazed terra
cotta, but the glaze is nothing more than the black
pigment with which the decoration is carried out.
The uncolored part of the clay is not glazed but polished
with a hard tool. Probably some famous potters
employed assistants either to make the pieces or
to decorate but it does not appear that there was any
reproduction, at least, during the best period. At
first primitive ideas prevailed. Geometric designs
were succeeded by rhythmic friezes of beasts and birds
done in black. When the human figure made its appearance
the faces were all in profile with full-fronting
eye while the prominent details of feature and
drapery were scratched with a sharp point before
burning.</p>

<p>The change of method to red on black gave much
wider scope for the treatment of the human figure,
rendered a fuller expression possible and enlarged the
power of pictorial action. Great skill in drawing was
manifested and details of both drapery and features
were expressed with great care by means of the brush.</p>

<p>Such was the state of the art when the decadence
set in and the work fell into the hands of plagiarists
and charlatans. Meretricious coloring and gaudy ornament
succeeded the refinement and restraint of the
earlier days and so the art perished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>To the inventive power of the Romans the ceramic
art owes more than one novelty. It would appear that
the desideratum of the early days was a black ware.
Homer in his hymn wrote:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Pay me my price, potters, and I will sing.<br />
Attend, O Pallas, and with lifted arm protect their ovens,<br />
Let all their cups and sacred vessels blacken well<br />
And baked with good success yield them<br />
Both fair renown and profit."
</div>

<p>The Greeks accomplished this blackening by means
of a pigment, the Romans secured a similar result by
a manipulation of the fire.</p>

<p>It is well known that the oxide of iron which imparts
to the clay a red color will, if burned in what is
known as a "reducing" fire, turn black. This is accomplished
by keeping the air supply at the lowest
possible point and the effect is heightened by the
smoke which is partly absorbed by the clay. This
black ware is known as Upchurch pottery from the
name of a locality in England where large quantities
have been found, but numerous examples occur in
Germany and, indeed, wherever the Roman hosts encamped.</p>

<p>A second type of pottery is called Castor ware and
consists of a dark clay upon which the decoration is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
traced in clay of a lighter color. The decoration was
applied as a slip or cream and hence was the forerunner
of the modern slip painting or <i>p&acirc;te-sur-p&acirc;te</i>.
This ware is well worth a study. The decorations
consisted largely of conventional borders and panels
but it is specially notable on account of the free use
of motives drawn from daily life. One of the commonest
scenes depicted is the hunt of hare or stag,
the animals and trees being often woven into an almost
conventional frieze.</p>

<p>The most valued type of Roman pottery seems to
have been the Aretine or Samian ware. This is a
bright red color and possesses an extremely thin
glaze. A particular clay was evidently used, but all
knowledge of its source has been lost.</p>

<p>With the importation of Chinese porcelain by the
Dutch the whole trend of pottery manufacture was
changed. No longer was black a desirable color, white
was seen to be much more delicate and beautiful and
henceforth the endeavor of the potter was to produce
a ware which should be as nearly like porcelain as
possible. The crudeness of the clay kept this ideal
from being realized, but various expedients were
adopted and gradually better results were obtained.</p>

<p>Throughout the East a type of white pottery was
made which, though stimulated by the Chinese example,
may have been a relic of the knowledge of the
Egyptians. A crude clay was coated with a white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
preparation, possibly ground quartz, and upon this
there were painted conventional designs in sombre
colors. A clear glaze covered the whole and imparted
to the colors a beautiful quality as of pebbles under
water. The nature of the glaze is made evident by
the hues assumed by the metallic oxides employed
as colorants. Copper oxide affords a turquoise blue,
manganese, a wine purple, and iron, a brick red. If
the glaze had contained any considerable amount of
lead oxide, these colors would have been quite different;
copper would have produced green, manganese,
dark brown, and iron, yellowish brown. The iron
pigment was evidently a clay, sometimes spoken of
as Armenian bole. The red color is always in raised
masses because if a thin wash had been used the
color would have yielded to the action of the glaze.</p>

<p>This ware, commonly called Oriental <i>engobe</i> ware,
affords a fruitful study. Effects similar in character
were produced by the late Theodore Deck of Paris,
but no considerable use of the ancient methods has
ever been attempted.</p>

<p>The use of tin and lead in glazing was known to
the Arabian and Moorish potters but these ingredients
were not abundant in the East. When, however, the
Moorish hosts conquered a part of Spain in the twelfth
century it was found that both lead and tin were
available. The result was the development of the
enameled ware known by the generic name Maiolica.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Some have maintained that this was first made in
Italy but the name is derived from the island of Maiorca
from which much of the pottery was exported.
The famous Alhambra vase remains as a monument
to the skill of the Hispano-Moresque craftsmen, but
it was the Italian artists of the Renaissance who
brought the enameled wares to perfection. The interest
here is artistic and technical rather than historical,
but no one can study the work of the period without
learning something of Luca della Robbia and Giorgio
Andreoli, of Gubbio and Pesaro and Castel Durante.</p>

<p>The use of lead in the glaze proved seductive. It
simplified the technical problems and provided a brilliant
surface but alas! the colors suffered and one by
one they succumbed. The blue of cobalt, however,
proved indestructible and so, when the technical
knowledge of the South met the traditions borrowed
from the Chinese, there was born, in the little town
of Delft in Holland, the blue enameled ware which
has ever since been known by the name of its native
place.</p>

<p>As to the technical details of the production of
Delft ware a great deal of information is available.
The clay used contained a goodly proportion of lime
and this served to hold the enamel in perfect union
with the body. The decoration was painted in cobalt
blue upon the unburned surface of the enamel. This
was, in a measure, courting a difficulty but it is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
glory of the craft that a difficulty is cheerfully accepted
if in the overcoming there is found success.
If the Delft potters had burned their enamel in order
to make the painting easy, the world would never
have enjoyed the tender tone of blue for which this
pottery is famous. By painting the blue color over
the powdery enamel, a more perfect union of enamel
and color was accomplished than would have been possible
by any other means. This fact alone is sufficient
to account for the unsatisfactory nature of the modern,
so-called, Delft. Difficulties have been avoided
rather than met and the success of the early masters
has eluded their recent followers.</p>

<p>Much of the pottery made in France in the seventeenth
century was inspired by the Italian renaissance.
In fact the word faience is due to the avowed intention
of the manufacturers of Nevers to copy the enameled
pottery of Faenza. Almost the only novelty of the
time was the inversion, by the Nevers potters, of the
Delft idea. Instead of a white enamel with a blue
decoration they used, in part, a blue ground with a
decoration in white. It is not known that this variation
found acceptance in any other place but in many
localities, notably at Rouen, the manufacture of enameled
wares was pursued with great success. The only
real difference between the wares of Spain, Italy and
France, lies in the decorative treatment. Sometimes
the emphasis was laid upon lustres, sometimes on blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and white and again upon polychrome painting. In
one place there was an extensive use made of pictorial
treatment, in another all was conventional. The differences
are interesting to a student or a collector
but to the craftsman enameled pottery affords but
one, though by no means an unimportant, means of
expression.</p>

<p>France, however, gave birth to two important and
interesting departures from the beaten track; the so-called
Henri deux ware, and the faience of Bernard
Palissy. Important as these are to the ceramist, it is
a remarkable fact that neither of them had any appreciable
influence upon the art as a whole nor did
they leave any descendants.</p>

<p>A good deal of controversy has raged around the
pottery commonly known as Henri II, some authorities
claiming that it should be called Faience d'Oiron,
and others assigning to it the name Saint Porchaire.
It was, quite evidently, the production of an individual
or group of individuals who had no connection with
ordinary pottery manufacture, and the small quantity
produced is evidence that it was made for personal
pleasure. The name Henri II is undoubtedly satisfactory,
for it was made in the reign of the second
Henry and some pieces bear the monogram of the
king. On the other hand H may be the initial of
Helene d'Hengest, who occupied the chateau d'Oiron
and who had in her employ one Bernard who filled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the position of librarian. The style of the work seems
to indicate a devotion to books, for the patterns are
suggestive of book-binding tool work but were not
produced in the same way. The ware was made of
a natural cream-colored clay and the shapes were
modeled with great skill. Upon the plain surface
patterns were tooled or incised and the hollows thus
formed were filled in with dark-colored clays. The
whole was then covered with a clear lead glaze which
afforded a finish very much like modern earthenware.</p>

<p>The origin of this work is a matter of little more
than academic interest but the technical details are of
such importance as to be well worth a study. The
ware is original and unique. No pottery either before
or since has approached it in method, and the quality
of most of the pieces is all that could be desired.
Such was the elaboration of detail that no price could
have been set upon the ware and it was evidently
not made for sale. A distinct growth in style can be
traced. The first pieces were somewhat archaic and
even crude but as skill was acquired greater perfection
was attained. As is too often the case, however,
the skillful hand overreached itself and the later
pieces are loaded with meretricious detail in many
colors. There are only about fifty pieces known and
these are equally divided between the museums of
France and England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Bernard Palissy was a versatile genius but is here
only considered as a potter. He states in his records
that he was inspired by seeing an enameled cup. It
was at one time supposed that this cup was of Italian
maiolica but later authorities incline to the belief that
it was a piece of Chinese porcelain which Palissy supposed
to have been enameled. No white clay was
known to him but enameled wares were quite accessible.
It can scarcely be believed that maiolica was a
novelty but it can easily be understood that a piece
of white porcelain, viewed in the light of the contemporary
knowledge of enamels, would appear of marvellous
quality.</p>

<p>Palissy essayed to imitate this wonder but attacked
the problem from the standpoint of an opaque glaze.
He spent fifteen years in experimenting but never
realized his ideal. He did, however, produce a palette
of marvellous colored enamels. He was a close student
of nature and modeled all kinds of natural objects,
glazing them in the proper hues. He also designed
and made vases and service pieces, some with
figure embossments. The story of his struggles is
readily accessible to any who are interested.</p>

<p>Palissy left little or no impression upon the ceramic
art of his time but in recent years some work has been
done in colored glazes fusible at a low temperature.
This ware is sometimes sold under the name of
maiolica but it is more nearly an imitation of Palissy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
The main difference between the two types is that
while the maiolica or tin-glazed pottery of Spain, Italy
and France consisted for the most part of a white
enameled surface upon which painting was applied,
Palissy used little or no white enamel but decorated
his wares with tinted glazes which themselves supplied
the colors.</p>

<p>In the low countries and the German states there
was made the striking and original pottery known as
<i>Gr&egrave;s de Flandres</i>. The clay was of the type commonly
used for the manufacture of stone-ware and appears
in three colors, brown, gray and cream. The ware
was made on the wheel and embossments more or less
elaborate were subsequently added. The unique feature
consisted in the method of applying the glaze.
This was simply common salt, thrown into the heated
kiln and volatilized. The salt vapor bathed the glowing
pottery and combined with its substance, thus
producing the delightful orange-skin texture known
as salt glaze.</p>

<p>The knowledge of this method was conveyed to
England in the seventeenth century and gained wide
acceptance there. The English potters preferred to
use clays which were almost white, and after glazing
a decoration in brilliant colors was sometimes added.
Naturalistic treatment was not attempted but conventionalized
subjects were used with almost the effect
of jewelry. The temperature at which this work can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
be produced varies with the clay. Many fusible clays
will take a salt glaze but the beauty of the product
depends to a large extent upon the purity of the body.
This necessitates a hard fire, for white-burning clays
always need a high temperature for vitrification. The
early potteries of England were dependent largely
upon clay effects. Some little enameled ware was
made and is known as English Delft; but the bulk of
the work was slip painted, incised, marbled or embossed.
Each of these methods is capable of an intelligent
application and all are within the reach of
the artist potter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_III'>
CHAPTER III<br />
<span class='exp'>Porcelain</span>
</h2>

<p>The production of porcelain is the goal of the
potter. The pure white of the clay and the
possibility of unlimited fire treatment exert a profound
influence upon the imagination while the difficulties
of manipulation only serve to stimulate the
energy of the enthusiast. For present purposes not
much is to be learned from the soft porcelains of
France nor from the bone china of England. German
and French hard porcelain are but developments of
the Chinese idea and therefore need not be studied
apart from their prototype.</p>

<p>The earliest date of Chinese porcelain is unknown.
The records of the nation are very ancient but their
meaning is often obscured by the fact that in the
Chinese language the same word was used of old
to denote both porcelain and earthenware. Specimens
dating from only the tenth century A. D. look almost
incredibly old. They are coarse and heavy in structure
but are aglow with vibrant color. The finest
porcelains date from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries
and these are the ideals towards which every
modern potter looks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Broadly it may be stated that two methods prevailed.
In the former the glaze itself was charged
with color or the coloring matter was applied to the
clay beneath the glaze. In the latter the porcelain
was finished as to body and glaze and the decoration
was applied at a subsequent and much lighter burn.</p>

<p>The first named class is called single-colored porcelain;
the second has several names such as the
famille rose and famille verte as defined by Jacquemart.</p>

<p>In the single-color class it is evident that the potters
were not at all sure of their results. In many
museums there are to be found examples of ox-blood
red, more or less fine, and, with them, other pieces
which were intended to be red but which failed in
the fire. The wonder is, in these cases, that the pieces,
even though failures, are beautiful. The knowledge
required for the production of these wares is largely
scientific; at the same time it is not to be believed
that the Chinese had any special scientific training.
They evidently traveled a long and tortuous path before
the goal was reached, in fact, they often fell short
of it altogether, but they had plenty of time and unlimited
patience. The modern potter is, if less patient,
more fortunate in that the course has been marked
out with more or less accuracy and, if the landmarks
of science be heeded, a certain degree of success may
be attained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>This single-color work is the true field of the
ceramist. Anyone possessing the power of using a
pencil, and with a large stock of patience, may produce
over-glaze decoration, but to prepare glazes of
many hues and to consign them unprotected to the
fury of the furnace, requires skill, patience, courage
and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>During the last twenty years a new school has
arisen which combines in a measure the advantages of
the two Chinese methods. Colors are prepared from
refractory materials and upon clay or soft burned
biscuit ware, scenes, in more or less conventional
form, are painted, or else a design purely conventional
in character is applied by the artist. The ware is
then glazed and subjected to the severe fire which all
porcelain undergoes. The result is that the porcelain
and the painting are united in a sense that can never
be the case with over-glaze treatment. The colors
become part of a purely ceramic unit; the spirit of
the artist is fixed by the fire.</p>

<p>To this class belong the porcelain of Copenhagen
and the recent product of Sevres. These, of course,
represent the result of much arduous training and
many tedious experiments. Both the training and the
experiments are necessary to some extent for every
worker, not only because pottery clays vary much in
composition, but because individuality can only be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
obtained by the preparation, in the laboratory, of the
desired compounds.</p>

<p>The Chinese, doubtless, stumbled upon many of
their successes by accident, helped by the fact that the
character of the fire employed influenced many of
their colors. This will be explained in a later chapter.
They were, however, quick to seize upon that
which was good. Many fanciful names were given to
the rarest colors, such as "the violet of wild apples,"
"liquid dawn" and "the red of the bean blossom."
This idea has been carried further in France by the
invention of such names as "<i>Sang-de-boeuf</i>," "<i>Sang-de-poulet</i>,"
"<i>clair-de-lune</i>," etc., and pursued in this
country in "Peach blow."</p>

<p>In the over-glaze treatment, the type named "famille
verte" is characterized by a clear green glaze
or enamel over a design in black. The whole is
painted over the porcelain glaze and the green enamel
is so soft that it is often decomposed on the surface.
When a broad black mass is covered with green the
decomposition gives rise to prismatic colors and occasions
the term "raven's wing black." Some of
this ware has also been gilt but the gold lines have
disappeared and can only be located by the slight
dullness of the enamel where they once were. Well
known to collectors also are the rose-back plates.
These belong to the "famille rose" in which the
characteristic note is a delicate rose pink. This color
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
is prepared from gold and when it is placed upon
the back of an egg-shell plate a tender rosy transparency
is imparted to the piece. One of the best
known of the single colors is the pale sea green
named celadon by the French. This color in China
was called "the sky after rain" and was considered
both rare and valuable.</p>

<p>The porcelain of Copenhagen is the product of
scientific skill and artistic taste. In the studios attached
to the Royal Manufactory there has grown up
a tradition of work and criticism which is fostered
by ladies of birth and position. Many of these paint
upon the porcelain themselves and so constitute a
school which has become world famous.</p>

<p>Natural objects are, for the most part, chosen and,
as the palette of colors is, owing to the intense fire,
quite limited and low in key, a tone of quiet atmosphere
pervades the painting. This is accentuated by
the use of the air-brush to distribute a ground color
upon the ware in graduated strength.</p>

<p>At the National Manufactory of Sevres there has
been some attempt to follow the Copenhagen method
but to a greater extent the work is along the lines of
conventionalized form. In this treatment the French
artists excel, being wonderfully accurate&mdash;almost too
accurate&mdash;in their lines and spacing. Several individual
workers in France have also pursued this plan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
designing and executing the pieces which have made
the French artist-potters famous.</p>

<p>In the porcelains of Berlin the quality lies largely
in the complete mastery of technical details. The
work is, as would be expected, German in style, but
the paste is pure and the colors are well prepared.</p>

<p>From this brief review it will be seen that the interest
in the manufacture of porcelain lies not so much
in variety as in the value of individual results. In the
pottery described in the previous chapter a great many
different clays were used and each one proved suggestive
to the potter. In porcelain, on the other hand,
the body clay is almost identical wherever prepared,
the requirement of a white translucent paste being
paramount.</p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_IV'>
CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class='exp'>The Nature and Properties of Clay</span>
</h2>


<p>Clay differs from earth or soil in that it possesses
certain characteristics which these do not
possess. Its distribution is very wide but for the most
part it lies concealed from view. In certain parts of
the country it is so abundant that it breaks through the
surface or is exposed as an outcrop but usually it is
covered by the soil which supports vegetation. Unless
the subsoil consists of sand it is easy to expose
a clay by plowing or digging with a spade. It usually
appears as a greenish or bluish substance of close and
uniform structure. The texture is sometimes smooth
but more often numerous small stones are found imbedded
in the mass. Such clays as are commonly
found can be used for the manufacture of some kind
of pottery but in the great majority of cases the ware
will be red when fired because the clay contains a
proportion of oxide of iron. A pure clay does not
contain this and therefore becomes white or nearly
white in the kiln.</p>

<p>Pure clay, known as clay base or clay substance
forms a part of all natural clays though sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
only a small part. It consists of silica, alumina and
water in a state of combination and is thus known
as a hydrous aluminium silicate. While this substance
is very common as an ingredient of ordinary clay,
it is rarely found alone or uncontaminated. Commercial
or workable clays may be said to consist of clay
base and sand, with or without other impurities such
as lime and oxide of iron. For working purposes it
may be granted that the potter has to deal with a
mixture of clay and sand. But sand is not a definite
expression. It may vary both physically and chemically
within wide limits. The physical nature has
to do with condition, the chemical with composition.
Thus a sand may be almost as coarse as gravel or
as fine as the clay itself. It may be a pure quartz
sand or it may be a crushed rock of almost any composition.
The former is known as quartz, the latter
as feldspar or feldspathic sand because it approaches
in composition the group of minerals known as feldspars.
Each of these ingredients, clay, quartz and
feldspar, has an important part to play in the transformation
of clay into pottery. Few of the clays
used in making white pottery possess these ingredients
in the correct proportions so that it becomes
necessary to make a mixture in which the necessary
proportions will be found.</p>

<p>For successful pottery making three properties are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
demanded in a clay. First, plasticity. Without this,
clay could not be shaped at all. It constitutes the
obedience of a clay to the forming influence whether
hand or mold. The necessity for this quality may
be illustrated by the proverb "Making ropes of sand"
as an example of the impossible. Sand, possessing no
plasticity, cannot be shaped or made to hold together.</p>

<p>The second property is porosity. A clay which exhibits
a high degree of plasticity can be easily shaped
but it cannot be safely dried. The water of plasticity
cannot escape and therefore the clay warps and cracks.
The function of porosity is to prevent this. A porous
clay permits the water to escape freely and the clay
can be dried without damage. This condition is produced
by the admixture of sand or by the presence
of sand in a natural clay. A coarse sand is more effective
than a fine sand but a sand that is too coarse
will interfere with delicate working while a sand that
is too fine approximates the action of the clay itself
and produces a substance which is dense rather than
porous. Porosity is therefore the reverse of plasticity
and these two properties must be adjusted so as to
balance each other.</p>

<p>The third necessary property is commonly known
as vitrification but could be better named "densification"
because complete vitrification is not attained
in ordinary clay wares. This property may be defined
as that which causes a clay to yield to the action of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
a high temperature so that the result is a ware, more
or less dense, which is hard, durable and sonorous.
With this there must be coupled a certain amount
of resistance to heat treatment so that the pottery
does not fuse or collapse during the firing. Here also
is found the need for adjustment. The clay must
yield to the fire but not completely. It must resist
but not entirely.</p>

<p>Plasticity is due to the clay base. Not only to its
quantity but to its quality also. Some forms of clay
in which clay base predominates are not plastic because
the clay base itself is coarse grained. Other
forms with less clay base present are plastic because
this ingredient is fine grained and tough. Pure clay
base is also highly resistant to fire and therefore contributes
to the refractoriness of the mass.</p>

<p>Porosity is caused by the sand in the clay. Any
kind of sand will produce porosity but the effect
differs with the condition of the sand. Coarse sand
is more effective than fine sand. More sand will, of
course, cause greater porosity.</p>

<p>Vitrification or densification is due to the feldspar
or fusible sand. This also varies with the condition.
A fine-grained feldspar will produce vitrification more
easily than the same amount of coarse feldspar.</p>

<p>Certain substances are available for use in pottery
mixtures, which possess one or other of the necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
properties in high degree so that they will impart
these properties to a mass to which they are added.</p>

<p>Kaolin or china clay is usually fine, white, and
refractory. Some kaolins are rather plastic but most
of them are "short" in working and rather tender.
For the production of a white ware kaolin is indispensable.
No other ingredient will afford the pure
white color which is sought after in porcelain and
china.</p>

<p>Ball clay is very plastic, easily vitrified, but is not
white. The color varies from a cream to a gray.
The use of a ball clay is therefore limited in white
wares because it will spoil the color. For wares in
which a light cream color is not objectionable ball
clays are valuable and almost indispensable.</p>

<p>Stoneware clay is usually a rather plastic clay which
contains a good deal of sand, hence stoneware clays
can be used for certain classes of ware without admixture.
A rather high temperature is required for
most of these clays, though occasionally one can be
found which will become dense at the fire of a studio
kiln. The clays sold by the Enfield Pottery Company
and by the Western Stoneware Company are of this
type.</p>

<p>Ground flint is a necessary ingredient in almost all
pottery. It aids in the porosity of the clay and enables
the mixture to be adjusted to fit a special glaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Ground feldspar is also necessary. Like flint it
aids in the porosity of the unburned clay but unlike
flint it produces density in the firing.</p>

<p>By a proper adjustment of these ingredients a clay
can be composed which will meet the special requirements
of the worker.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain the properties of any given
clay certain simple tests may be made and every
clay-worker should know how to do this because one
cannot be too well informed as to the materials to be
used.</p>

<p>First, water of plasticity. A certain portion of the
clay, dried and powdered, is weighed out. It is convenient
to weigh in grams and to measure in cubic
centimeters because in this way calculation is easy.
The scales and weights are described in the chapter
on glazes. For measuring the water a glass vessel
called a graduate is used. One holding a hundred
cubic centimeters and graduated in centimeters and
tenths can be obtained from a dealer in chemical supplies.
One hundred grams of clay is weighed out and
transferred to a glass slab. The graduate is filled
with water to the one hundred mark. Some of this
water is then poured on to the clay, adding little by
little as needed until the whole can be worked into
a stiff mass of the proper plasticity. The quantity
of water used is then carefully noted by observing
how much is left in the graduate. Suppose, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
instance, 70 cubic centimeters are found remaining,
the hundred grams of clay has absorbed thirty c.c.
of water and as one c.c. of water weighs one gram
the clay has taken just 30 per cent. This amount
is important because it is one of the best indications
of plasticity. A very plastic clay may need 40 per
cent, a non-plastic clay may be satisfied with 25
per cent.</p>

<p>Second, shrinkage. The mass of plastic clay is now
transferred to a plaster bat and rolled or pressed
out into a smooth slab about 12 centimeters long.
Here again the centimeter is used in preference to
the inch as being more easily calculated. A faint
line is ruled on the clay slab and two fine scratches
are marked exactly ten centimeters apart. The edges
are trimmed and the excess clay made up into three
or four small pieces which are to be fired in different
parts of the kiln as tests for density. When the
clay slab is dry the distance between the marks is
measured and noted. The ten centimeters being divided
into one hundred millimeters, each millimeter
of shrinkage means one per cent. After firing, a
second measurement is made and the differences are
noted as dry shrinkage and fire shrinkage respectively.</p>

<p>Third, firing. The slab with the measurement upon
it is set in the kiln in the place where the clay wares
are to receive the first or biscuit fire and the small
pieces are arranged in different places so as to secure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
as many different conditions as possible. The position
of each should be carefully recorded. After firing,
the marks on the slab are measured as already described
and note is taken of any warping of the piece.
The color is also recorded. The small pieces should
be tested for porosity or absorption of water but this
is rather a delicate operation and needs a particularly
sensitive balance. Generally it will suffice to use a
wet sponge or to dip each piece into water, removing
it quickly and noting carefully the rate of speed at
which the water is absorbed. If the water should be
scarcely absorbed at all a line of ink may be drawn
upon the pottery with a pen, the piece being perfectly
dry. In a fully vitrified ware the ink can be washed
off, leaving scarcely a mark but the test is quite sensitive
and with a little practice will afford an excellent
means of comparing the density of different clays
or of the same clay at different temperatures.</p>

<p>Fourth, glazing. It is well to have ready a small
supply of a standard clear glaze. Each of the test
pieces should be covered with this in a rather thin coat
and then they should all be fired again, this time close
together so that they will receive the same heat treatment.
This will enable one to determine what degree
of fire for the clay will best suit the glaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_V'>
CHAPTER V<br />
<span class='exp'>The Preparation of the Clay</span>
</h2>


<p>A clay having been selected in accordance with
the tests described, it becomes necessary to
prepare it for use. A fairly large supply should be
obtained and stored in a dry place. Most natural
clays need some kind of cleansing for there are almost
always foreign substances present. This cleansing is
accomplished by reducing the clay to the fluid known
as slip. The necessary appliances for making slip are
as follows:</p>

<ul class='plain'>
<li>A large sieve of quarter-inch mesh.</li>

<li>A small wire sieve of about 14 meshes to the inch.</li>

<li>A large barrel.</li>

<li>Two galvanized pails.</li>
</ul>

<p>The clay is, after drying, powdered and sifted
through the large sieve. One of the pails is half
filled with clean water and the clay, handful by handful,
is sprinkled into it. The clay rapidly absorbs the
water and sinks to the bottom. The addition of clay
is continued until a small mound rises through the
water, when the whole is left to soak for an hour.
The bared arm is then plunged into the pail and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
mass stirred vigorously. A stick or paddle will serve,
of course, but the potter learns a great deal by the
feel of the clay and therefore the hand is best. It is
said that he is a poor sailor who will not dip his hands
in the tar bucket and in like manner, he is a poor
potter who fears the slip tub. This stirring will tell
a good deal about the probable working of the clay.
It may be stony or sandy or greasy. The large stones
and roots will have been removed by the sieve but
now, after thorough mixing, the slip is poured through
the small sieve into the barrel. Both pails may be
kept going at once, one being filled while the other
is soaking and so on until the barrel is full or, at
least, a good quantity of slip has been prepared.</p>

<p>If the clay prove very sandy it should be washed.
The mixture in the pail having been well stirred is
allowed to stand for a definite time, say one minute.
The slip is then poured into the second pail and it
will be found that a quantity of sand has settled. This
is thrown away and the slip in the second pail is examined.
If enough sand has been removed, the slip
may be poured into the barrel, using the fine sieve as
already described. If still sandy the process should
be repeated, the settling being for two minutes. Experience
is the best guide in this operation but all
the sand should not be removed.</p>

<p>When the barrel is full of slip it is allowed to stand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
over night when some inches of clear water will be
found at the top. This is removed with a siphon
which may be made of a piece of lead or rubber pipe.
The removal of the water results in the thickening
of the slip and the contents of the barrel should be
thoroughly stirred with a long wooden paddle to insure
a uniform consistency. If the slip is found to
be still thin another settling and removal of the water
will thicken it.</p>

<p>The slip thus prepared will keep indefinitely, provided
that it is not allowed to become dry by evaporation.
It improves greatly with age. This is the material
which is used for casting as will be described
later but for plastic work it must be still further thickened.
A shallow box may be procured and made
water-tight and the slip, when poured into it, will
thicken much more rapidly than in the barrel, but it
is better to have some shallow plaster dishes as the
plaster itself absorbs the water and thickens the clay.
Instructions for making these dishes appear in the
chapter on plaster.</p>

<p>These directions will suffice for the preparation of
a natural clay but it is sometimes desired to prepare
a white body either of earthenware or porcelain.
These bodies do not exist in nature and therefore a
mixture must be made. The ingredients are kaolin or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
white porcelain clay, ball clay or plastic potters' clay,
ground quartz or flint, and ground feldspar.<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_B' id='FNanchor_B' href='#Footnote_B'>[B]</a></p>

<p>A suitable mixture for earthenware is&mdash;</p>

<tr><td>Feldspar</td><td>20 &nbsp;" &nbsp;" &nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>100</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The earthenware will be creamy in color and porous
at an ordinary fire. The porcelain will need a hard
fire and will be white and translucent. It is, however,
non-plastic and hard to work. The preparation of
these mixtures of course necessitates a pair of scales
but otherwise the treatment of the mix is the same as
that of natural clay. Washing is not necessary but
the clay must be powdered, mixed with the flint and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
spar, and sprinkled into water as already described.
In place of the wire sieve, however, a silk lawn of 120
meshes to the inch should be used.</p>

<p>The lawn is simply a fine sieve and is named because
of the material (also called bolting cloth), with
which it is covered. Have a carpenter make a box
without a bottom. Cypress or oak should be used and
this should be a full half inch thick. Four strips of
the same thickness are also to be provided. The box
may be of any convenient size; eight inches square and
four inches deep is about right. The sides should be
fastened together with brass screws to avoid rust and
a piece of lawn is strained tightly across the bottom
and secured with copper or brass tacks. A strip of
coarse muslin folded and laid along the edges will
help to prevent the lawn from tearing, the tacks being,
of course, driven through both muslin and lawn. Then
the four wooden strips are set upon the muslin and
secured with brass screws. The completed lawn is
then a tray of which the bottom is formed of lawn.
The strips of wood beneath serve to protect the lawn
when placed on a table as well as to assist in holding
it firmly.<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_D' id='FNanchor_D' href='#Footnote_D'>[D]</a></p>

<p>For storing clay in the plastic state there is nothing
better than stoneware jars. These may be had of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
size and a tinman should make close-fitting covers.
Earthenware covers do not fit tight and are always
getting broken. A little water is poured into each jar
and a support provided for the clay so that it does
not rest in contact with the water. Under any conditions
clay will slowly harden so that not too large
a stock should be kept. Slip, on the other hand, keeps
well so long as some water is always on the top and
it is not a long process to stiffen it into clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_VI'>
CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class='exp'>Mold-making and Plaster</span>
</h2>


<p>Plaster is almost a necessity to the potter and
therefore something should be learned about it.
Even if one does not use molds there are numberless
purposes for which plaster is convenient. For stiffening
slip into clay, and for absorbing water from glazes,
shallow dishes of plaster are used, and for holding
work either in making or drying, plaster bats or round
slabs are always in demand.</p>

<p>It is best to purchase the finest quality of potters'
plaster by the barrel.<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_E' id='FNanchor_E' href='#Footnote_E'>[E]</a> It will keep indefinitely if
stored in a dry place. The necessary appliances are:</p>

<ul class='plain'>
<li>One or two large jugs for mixing, or a metal can with a spout.</li>

<li>A metal spider or frying pan.</li>

<li>Six feet of rubber machine belting, six inches wide,
or similar strips cut from linoleum or enameled cloth.</li>

<li>Two or three thin pieces of steel of various degrees
of flexibility (scrapers).</li>

<li>Handy knives, called vegetable knives.</li>

<li>A small painter's brush.</li>

<li>Two or three fine sponges.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>To begin with, a size of soft soap and water is prepared.
Put a quart of water into a kettle and add
a piece of soap the size of an egg.<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_F' id='FNanchor_F' href='#Footnote_F'>[F]</a> Simmer for an
hour or until the soap is entirely dissolved and then
set aside to cool. When cold the size should be of the
consistency of maple syrup. This size is used whenever
plaster is to be kept from sticking to a form or
surface, and it has also the merit of causing clay to
stick to plaster. For example, if a mold is to be taken
from a clay model no size should be used, but if a
plaster form is used as a foundation for clay ornament
it should be well sized first. The size is laid on with
a brush and wiped off with a sponge. Another sponge
is then used with clean water and the sized surface
is washed, all superfluous water being removed. Size
is then applied a second time and washed off as before.
A third application is sometimes necessary, or
until the sized surface rejects water like grease does.
On the last sizing, water is not applied, but the surface
is polished with the sponge containing size. If
the surface to be prepared be of wood or metal a
single coat of size will often suffice, but if it be of
plaster three or four applications are often necessary.</p>

<p>The first lesson may well be the manufacture of a
plaster bat. The frying pan is first sized and set
upon a level table. Let us suppose that a quart of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
water will fill it to about an inch in depth. This
amount of water is put into a jug and two pounds
and three-quarters of dry plaster is weighed out and
allowed to trickle through the fingers into the water.
This proportion has been found to be best for ordinary
mixings. A smaller quantity of plaster to the quart
of water will result in a very soft bat; a larger quantity
will be proportionately harder. After the plaster
has soaked up all the water it will take, that is in
about two minutes' time, the hand is plunged in and
the whole stirred to a smooth cream. All lumps must
be broken up and the air bubbles removed as far as
possible. Continue stirring gently and presently the
mixture will be felt to grow thicker. The psychological
moment arrives when the plaster forms upon
the hand a white coating which cannot be shaken off.
The creamy liquid is then poured into the frying pan
which is gently shaken to level the surface.</p>

<p>If the plaster has been poured at the right moment
it will set smoothly with a mat surface like sugar
icing. If poured too late it will be stiff and difficult
to level, and if poured too soon it will curdle on the
surface and water will be seen above the plaster. A
little practice will show the right moment. The jug
should be washed out immediately while the plaster
is soft. In the place used for plaster work a tub
should be provided in which all vessels and tools can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
be washed, for, if allowed to flow down the waste pipe
of a sink, the plaster will speedily choke the outflow.</p>

<p>After standing for some ten minutes, more or less,
the bat in the frying pan will grow warm. This is
the sign of a combination between the plaster and the
water and shows the completion of the setting. The
pan is now taken by the handle and, holding it upside
down, the edge is rapped smartly on a brick or stone.
This will cause the contents to fall out and there is
a smooth disc which is one of the most useful of appliances.
The edge will need to be scraped and the
bat can be set aside until needed. It will be good
practice to make a half dozen of these.</p>

<p>This process of mixing and pouring plaster is the
same for all operations and the instructions will not
be repeated, but when the student is told to "pour
plaster" it will be presumed that this experiment has
already been made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The next step is the making of a plaster bowl or
dish for the purpose of drying out slip or glaze. A
convenient size should be determined upon as it is
best to have all the dishes the same. Upon any flat,
smooth surface a mound of clay is reared which shall
be the size and depth of the inside of the proposed
dish. About twelve inches in diameter and three
inches deep is a good size, though fourteen inches is
not too large for the former dimension. This mound
should be made as nearly circular as possible and the
clay finished as smoothly as may be. The rubber
belt is then set around the mound in the form of a
hoop leaving a space of two inches between the clay
mound and the rubber hoop. The rubber is fastened
either by tying with string or by binding the overlapping
ends with clothes pins. A roll of soft clay
is laid down where the belt joins the table and pressed
down outside to prevent leakage. Enough plaster to
fill the space within the belt is now mixed and poured,
covering the clay mound to a depth of at least one
inch. When the plaster has set the rubber is detached,
the whole turned over and the clay dug out. We
have now a circular plaster dish three inches deep but
we have only one. The trouble of rebuilding the
clay is unnecessary a second time because a "case"
or reverse can be made from which as many dishes
as may be necessary can be formed.</p>

</div>

<p>The dish is carefully smoothed and trimmed. The
sharp edge is removed and the inside is dressed with
fine sandpaper to a perfectly smooth surface. Size is
now applied to the inside and upper edge until a bright
slippery surface is obtained. The rubber belt is now
bound closely around the dish and plaster is poured
to a depth of about one and one-half inches on the
edge. This, of course, makes a depth of four and
one-half inches in the center. When this new plaster
has set in turn the rubber is removed and the two
castings can be easily separated by inserting a knife
at the junction. The knife should be gently driven
in with a hammer. Obviously it is now possible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
make a number of dishes from the reverse thus obtained,
by simply binding the rubber belt around each
time and pouring plaster as at first. The original
mold having been sized is no longer absorbent but
must be kept in case additional reverses are needed.
The molds or dishes must be thoroughly dried out before
being used.</p>

<p>The molding of a vase form is more elaborate but
not really difficult. Even if one does not intend to
produce pottery by molding there is always an advantage
in having a number of simple forms upon
which to make experiments.</p>

<p>The vase to be molded is first drawn to exact size
upon paper and a plaster model is turned on a lathe.
This can be done equally well on the potters' wheel
and the method is as follows: A plaster bat is saturated
with water and set upon the wheel so as to
run true when the wheel is revolved, and is cemented
to the wheel head by a little slip. A few deep
scratches are made on the face of the bat and a
cylinder, either of the rubber belt or of stiff paper,
is rolled up and set on end in the center of the bat.
The size of the cylinder should be a little larger every
way than the proposed vase. Plaster is now mixed
and poured to fill the cylinder. It will adhere to the
bat below by reason of the scratches. When the
plaster has set, the cylinder is unfastened and removed
and the turning may begin. To turn plaster well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
involves a good deal of practice but it is better to spoil
three or four plaster cores in the learning than to
spend a long time on one for fear of damaging it.</p>

</div>

<p>The board support and turning stick described on
page 100 are used in turning plaster as well as clay.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
The turning stick is held in the left hand and the
point is pressed into the board. All this is, of
course, made ready before the plaster is poured. The
turning tools are here illustrated. They are not sold
in the stores but can be made by any machinist. The
head or cutting blade consists of a flat piece of steel
through the center of which is a shaft or pin which
is driven into a handle. The head may be of any
shape but the triangle and the circle will meet every
need. The tool is held in right hand and braced
against the turning stick, the stick and tool being
moved together by raising or lowering the left hand
which holds the butt of the stick.</p>

<p>While the plaster is still soft the round tool is used
and the rough form is rapidly turned. Then as the
setting of the plaster proceeds and it is found to grow
harder, the triangle tool should be used and the shape
gradually wrought out with the point. Finally by
using the circle tool for concave lines and an edge
of the triangle tool for convex lines the form is perfected.
The surface is to be finished and the tool
marks removed by using, free hand, a flexible scraper
which is bent by the fingers and thumb to fit the lines
of the form, and a final smoothing is given by fine
sandpaper, the wheel being revolved all the time. At
the top of the form a small cylindrical piece is left,
called the "spare" which represents the thickness of
the mold substance, and for the bottom a small piece is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
turned in the shape of a truncated cone. The small
end of this should be the same diameter as the base of
the vase. These are shown in the illustration (Fig. 6).</p>

<div class='drawing' id='p052'>

<p>It will be obvious that in the directions given above
the base of the vase is not finished off and therefore
the form must be cut off from the bat, either by a
knife or saw, and the base is then finished by hand,
or by setting the form upside down in a clay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
cradle&mdash;called a "chum"&mdash;and turning the base true. The
form is now ready for molding.</p>

</div>

<p>The plaster vase is laid upon its side on a piece of
soft clay and a thin bat or plaster slab is cut to fit
the outline. This template should fit with reasonable
accuracy but need not be absolutely exact. A pair of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
these will be required, one to fit each side of the form.
These slabs or sheets of plaster are always useful and
if a sheet of glass is kept handy any excess of plaster
left from a mixing may be poured on to it. This
upon setting is easily detached and will present a
smooth face where it has rested on the glass. The
pair of templates must include, in their outline, both
the spare and the foot piece but should not extend
beyond either of these. The outside diameter of the
mold is now to be determined and the templates cut
to this dimension so that the two together, with the
vase between them, constitute a longitudinal section
of the mold.</p>

<p>The vase must now be divided accurately into two
halves by a line running from top to bottom. There
are several ways of doing this. While the form is
still on the bat a diameter of the bat may be drawn
and a perpendicular erected from each end of this
diameter. These perpendicular lines will, of course,
mark the center of the vase on each side; or after
the vase has been cut off another method is possible.
With a pair of dividers find the center of both the
top and the bottom of the vase. Mark each with a
small hole or the point of a pencil. Now lay the vase
on its side on the clay cradle upon a glass sheet or
other level surface and raise or depress one end until
the two centers are exactly the same height from the
glass. Take this height in the dividers and, sliding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
one of the compass legs along the glass, gently scratch
the plaster vase with the other or upper point. If
the two centers have been accurately adjusted this
scratch line will be the exact center of the form.</p>

<p>Some soft clay is now built up on each side of the
vase and the templates are pressed down upon it, one
on each side until the upper face of each corresponds
with the scratched line. The vase is now seen to be
buried as to one half in a plaster surface, and plaster
poured on this will give a half mold. There is yet,
however, nothing to confine the plaster and it would
flow away as fast as poured. Two end plates are
necessary and these must rise in a half circle above
the bed formed by the templates. The part below
may be of any shape but must be high enough to
cause the diameter of the half circle to coincide with
the plane of the templates. Two pieces of cardboard,
wood, or rubber belt are now bound to the sides,
the apertures at the top and bottom, caused by the
curve of the end plates, are stopped with clay and the
whole presents the appearance of a vase, only half
of which is visible, lying in a shallow trough. All the
fitting should be carefully done but the tying up is
not yet. The whole is now taken apart and well sized.
Vase, foot piece, templates and end pieces are all
to be sized thoroughly in the manner described. They
are then put together again and bound around with
twine. It is necessary now to make provision for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
proper fitting of the halves of the mold. This is
done by providing knobs and hollows which fit together.
These are technically known as "natches"
and will be referred to as such. Take two pieces of
moderately stiff clay each about the size of a cherry.
Roll them into neat balls and cut them in two with
a thin knife. Lay each of the halves, flat side down,
upon the templates, two on each, placing them in pairs
opposite to each other. Affix two or more of these
on the inner face of the bottom end plate. Now mix
and pour the plaster. This should be poured to the
height of the top of the end plates and, after pouring,
shake this well down by dipping the fingers into it,
so that no bubbles may cling to the surfaces below.
As soon as the plaster has become firm but while it is
still soft remove the string and the side boards, pull
off the pieces of clay and with a straight, thin piece
of wood scrape off the surplus of plaster by following
the line of the end plates and thus making a half
cylinder.</p>

<p>As soon as the plaster has become warm the whole
may be turned over and the templates and end plates
removed. The four half spheres of clay will be found
embedded in the face of the plaster and these, being
removed, will leave four hemispherical depressions.
The vase can now be gently detached from its bed
and the first half of the mold is completed. A little
dressing will be necessary. All overhanging edges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and rough places should be finished off and the hollow
natches smoothed with a piece of muslin on the end
of a finger.</p>

<p>The second half is simple. Replace the vase in the
half mold, set the foot piece in its place, replace the
end plates with the diameter on the line as before but
with the semi-circular edges upward, and set two or
three clay natches on the bottom one. Size, bind up,
pour and scrape off as before, thus completing the
two halves of the mold in cylindrical form. It only
now remains to make the bottom for, at present, the
mold is open at both ends.</p>

<p>The two halves with the vase inside are bound very
tightly together with twine and set on the table bottom
upwards. The clay natches in the bottom are
taken out and the hollows smoothed. The foot piece
is taken out and the rough places dressed. The bottom
end of the vase is now visible and this, together
with the end of the mold, is sized. A strip of stout
paper is bound around the mold, projecting about an
inch above the end and plaster is poured to fill it.
When this is set the paper is peeled off and the edges
of the mold are dressed smooth. The bottom may
now be detached by inserting a thin knife at the junction,
the mold opened and the form taken out. The
mold is now in three parts which may be put together
at will and used for casting the vase in clay.</p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_VII'>
CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class='exp'>Cases and Working Molds</span>
</h2>

<p>The mold described in the previous chapter is
called, technically, a "block mold" and is not,
as a rule, used for making the clay ware. The reason
for this is that molds will wear out more or less
rapidly and to repeat the process of making new ones
from the original form would be tedious and expensive.</p>

<p>From the block mold a reverse is made, called a
"case," and from this, in turn, working molds are
made in any required number. While it is possible to
use the block mold as a working mold, and, if only
a few pieces are required this is quite sufficient, yet,
as it is often necessary to have a number of molds,
the student should understand how to make a case.</p>

<p>A case may be defined as a mold from which a
mold is made. If one can imagine the visible half of
the vase form as it appears in making the mold, with
the templates and ends cemented into one piece, one
has a conception of one half of a case. The problem
is to make this with permanent but movable ends so
as to have a convenient form from which half molds
may be easily made.</p>

</div>

<p>The ends are joined to the body by means of offsets
and the first step is the construction of these.
One half of the block is taken and laid upon its
back, being supported by clay so that the face is level
and steady. An offset plate is now cut to fit each
end. To make these a piece of plaster is selected or
made which is true and smooth on both sides. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
plates are cut of the same width as the mold and are
beveled at the upper edge so as to rise slightly from
the mold face. The curve at the end of the mold is
cut out to fit and beveled in like manner. Then two
end plates are fitted. These should be about two inches
higher than the offset plates and are square at the
top. Upon each of these two or three clay natches
are set, being placed low down near the face of the
mold. The mold and plates are well sized and bound
together with side walls just as in the making of the
mold. Plaster is poured to a height sufficient to well
cover the natches and left to set hard. No shaping
is necessary. When well set the end plates and offset
plates are removed but the vase mold and the
case are left attached together. The other half of
the mold is prepared and run in the same way, the
same offset plates and end plates being used with such
slight refitting as may be necessary. The work is
now examined and all rough places and scraps of adhering
plaster are removed. The two halves of the
case, the half molds being still attached, are set up
on end, back to back, being separated by a thin piece
of plaster or a strip of cardboard which should extend
two inches above the top. The top ends are now
sized, the natch holes having been smoothed off, a
band of paper is tied around and plaster poured on
top to a depth of about one inch. When set the whole
is turned over and the operation is repeated on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
other end. After the final setting the ends are easily
removed and by the insertion of a thin knife driven
by a light blow, the molds and case are separated.
Each half case is now laid on its back and the proper
ends are fitted in place. It only now needs the usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
side walls to be tied on and molds can be made with
ease just as the original block mold was made.</p>

<div class='drawing' id='p061'>
  <img src='images/p061.png'
    alt='Fig. 10.' title='Fig. 10.' />
  <p><span class='sc'>Fig. 10.</span> Mold and case in position. The top ends are lifted to show
fitting.  The bottom ends are not shown.</p>
</div>

<p>It now remains to make a case of the bottom mold.
The bottom piece of the block mold is taken and sized
and with a strip of paper bound around it, plaster is
poured. The two are detached when set and the case
is finished. It consists of seven pieces; three are used
in each half and one for the bottom.</p>

<p>Thus equipped it is possible to make any number of
working molds and if the case should wear out or be
damaged, a new one can always be made from the
block mold. The block mold itself, having been sized,
is no longer absorbent and cannot be used for making
vases. The working molds should be thoroughly
dried before using and they will last longer.</p>

<p>Flat ware, such as plates and saucers, is made on,
not in, a mold. The diameter of the plate having been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
decided upon, a block of plaster three inches wider is
run. This is placed on the center of the wheel or
jigger and in it the face of the plate is turned. This
must be sunk below the level of the block and when
finished, must appear as though the plate itself were
embedded in the plaster. One half of the thickness
of the edge is shown in such a way that there is no
under cutting. Just outside of this edge the plaster
is turned so as to slope gently up to the level of the
block.</p>

</div>

<p>Without removing the block from the wheel the
face of the plate is well sized, a band of belting is
arranged, of the same diameter as the edge of the
slope and plaster is poured to a depth of three inches.
Out of this the back of the mold is turned as shown
in the illustration (Fig. 12).</p>

<div class='drawing' id='p063'>

<p>The top of this as it lies upside down is shaped
with a straight, almost upright slope which enables
the mold to be set securely in the wheel head. Around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the exposed edge of the original block, three or four
natches are now bored or cut. They should be placed
at irregular distances so that there will be no doubt
as to the putting together of the sides of the case.
If two circular pieces of plaster have to be set together
and held by natches there should always be
either this irregular spacing or some distinctive mark,
because if this be not provided for, two or three trials
will always be made before the correct fitting is found
and these trials wear out the natches very quickly.</p>

<p>The back of the plate mold and the edges of the
block are now sized and plaster is run to the level of
the highest part of the mold but no higher (Fig. 13).
When this is set, the two halves of the case can be
separated and the mold taken out. Now when the
halves of the case are fitted together there will be a
cavity the exact size of the mold. This can be filled
again and again with plaster, a new mold being formed
each time.</p>

<p>In order to use these molds a special head must be
provided for the wheel. The regular head of the
wheel should be detachable and in its place an iron
frame called a prong is fitted. This consists of a
collar either with a hollow cone or a screw to fit the
shaft of the wheel, and from this radiate four short
arms. In order to use this a circular block of plaster
some two or three inches thick is poured on a table
or slab and just as this is setting, the prong, upside
down, is pressed into it just below the surface and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
held there until the plaster is hard enough to support
the weight of the iron. When hard, the whole is
lifted and the prong with the plaster attached is set
in position on the wheel. This now forms a rough
plaster head and it must be turned true. In this head
a circular depression is to be turned which will exactly
fit the back of the plate molds. If the recess should
wear larger as it will if much used, a new head can
easily be run. The same principle can be applied to
the making of molds for saucers.</p>

<p>Cups and bowls are molded from the outside. A
block of plaster about one inch thicker than the height
of the proposed cup is taken and centered upon the
wheel. Out of this the piece is to be turned, upside
down, leaving a ledge or platform, the outside diameter
of which is the size of the mold. The rubber belt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
is tied around this and the mold poured. If for casting
this will suffice, but if it is intended to make the
cups upon the wheel the outside of the mold must be
turned to fit a wheel-head which is hollowed to receive
it. The making of the cups is described in
Chapter XI. A bowl is simply an enlarged cup.</p>

CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class='exp'>Building by Hand</span>
</h2>

<p>The production of pottery by hand is a form of
modeling but with the important difference
that while pieces modeled by art-school methods are
not intended to be preserved in the clay itself, built
pieces are destined for the fire. It is therefore necessary
not only that a special clay be used but that the
work be such as will hold under the strain of the burn.
The composition of the clay has been dealt with in
another chapter and it is presumed that the worker
has decided upon the proper mix or has procured a
suitable clay.</p>

<p>There are two possible treatments of built pottery;
the work may be finished by fingers and tools only
or it may be placed upon the wheel and turned to a
true surface. In the latter case the result is much the
same as if the piece were thrown on the wheel as
will be described. The principal point of difference is
that while building needs less practice than throwing,
turning a built piece is much more difficult and tedious
than turning a thrown one. It is almost impossible to
build with sufficient accuracy for the work to run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
true, and a great deal of time is consumed in filling
hollows and removing lumps. These do not appear
obtrusive when the work is held in the hand, but if
it be revolved upon a fixed center every slight irregularity
appears to be accentuated. On the other hand
the charm of built ware lies in the subtle plastic quality
which belongs to no other material or method.</p>

<p>For very large pieces such as tree pots the combination
method is useful but these should be built on
the wheel itself and kept true as the work proceeds.
Then a slight turning at the finish, when the clay is
leather hard, will produce a satisfactory result.</p>

<p>The clay for building should be rather soft as it is
apt to dry quickly on handling. The work may be
done either with coils or pieces.</p>

<p>A plaster bat should be made with a low dome in
the center. This bat may either fit the wheel or not,
depending upon the plan adopted. The dome is to
raise up the bottom of the vase and form a foot. The
table may be covered with a piece of oil cloth or may
be kept slightly damp. The first attempt should be to
build a cylinder as this form is easy to construct and
to keep true, so that the attention may be devoted to
the manipulation of the clay.</p>

<p>It is first necessary to roll out the clay into cords
which should be a little thicker than the proposed
walls are to be. These cords should be as uniform as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
possible and should be rolled quickly to avoid undue
hardening. It is best to roll them as required. The
domed bat is made quite damp and upon it should be
marked the diameter of the cylinder to be built. A
roll of clay is taken, one end laid in the center of the
bat and the rest is coiled around it in a spiral line.
When the disc so formed has reached the proper size,
the coils are gently rubbed over with the fingers until
they have thoroughly united and the lines of the spiral
have disappeared. The clay disc may now be turned
over and the rubbing continued on the other side.
The circle is cut true and a new coil is laid on the
outer edge thus making a shallow circular tray. In
raising the walls it is best to pinch off the roll of clay
when one circle has been completed and the new roll
should be begun at another point so that all the joints
will not be at the same place. This plan is better
than coiling a long roll in a spiral for in this case one
side of the piece will be higher than the other.</p>

<p>After three rolls have been laid in position the wall,
both inside and out, should be worked like the bottom
so that the rolls will disappear and the clay be welded
uniformly together. This should be done without
water or with as little as possible. The use of water
is very tempting. It makes the clay so smooth and
seems to help but it will inevitably make the work
sloppy and will tend to soften the walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>After three or four rolls have been worked in, the
piece should be laid aside for some hours to stiffen.
If this be not done the weight of the second building
will cause the work to sag and fall out of shape. For
this reason it is well to have two or three pieces in
hand at once so that there need be no waiting. When
the cylinder is of sufficient height it should be allowed
to become quite stiff and then the irregularities should
be corrected with a little soft clay which is worked
into the joints. The whole surface may now be gone
over with tools and brought to the required finish.
As soon as the clay is hard enough it should be removed
from the damp bat and placed upon a dry one
to become dry.</p>

<p>In the method of building by pieces no rolls are
prepared but the clay is taken, pinch by pinch, each
morsel being pressed into place as the work goes on.
This plan is somewhat more plastic in effect and is
well adapted to free-hand work; the resulting pottery,
however, is generally thicker and heavier.</p>

<p>The craft of building is not mastered until the lines
of a drawing can be successfully followed. The clay
is apt to choose its own way and the result will be
very different from what the potter intended. The
design should be carefully worked out on paper, full
size if possible, and the clay form should be compared
with the drawing as the building goes on. A profile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
may be cut in cardboard and this, applied to the clay
from time to time, will verify the line, but all such
mechanical aids should be used sparingly as the value
of this work depends largely upon the sense of freedom
and self-expression which belongs to it.</p>

<p>The thickness of the clay walls is a matter of great
importance. A small piece should not be so thick as
to feel clumsy and heavy, nor should a large piece be
so thin as to lose the sense of strength and solidity.</p>

<p>It may be found on drying the ware, that cracks,
especially in the bottom, are developed. The cause
of this may be in the clay. A clay which is too plastic
or too fine in the grain will surely crack. Such a
clay may be opened or meagered by the addition of
ground flint or fine grog. The cause may, on the
other hand, be in the building. If the welding of the
coils or pieces be imperfectly done, cracks are sure to
result. If the bottom be too thick it will crack. A
great strain is put upon the bottom in drying. The
clay must be able to shrink and while the side walls
are able to settle down on themselves, the bottom is
pulled in every direction by the sides. The bottom
should be made quite thin in the center and thicker
toward the edges. This will help to avoid cracks. A
bad crack cannot be successfully mended. It is best
to break the piece and begin again. To burn it means
the loss of the clay but the clay will be saved if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
damaged work be withheld from the kiln. A small
crack on the edge is also hopeless. A crack showing
on the edge of a piece is a bad fault. A small crack
in the bottom may be mended by dampening the place
carefully and pressing in a little stiff clay.</p>

CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class='exp'>The Potter's Wheel</span>
</h2>

<p>Much of the glamour of the potter's art is associated
with the wheel. Poets have sung its
praise and artists have delighted in its rhythmic motion,
but alas! the wheel as a commercial method of
manufacture is doomed to extinction. It cannot compete
with the precision and speed of machinery. It devolves,
therefore, upon the artist potter to maintain
the wheel in its rightful place as, <i>par excellence</i>, the
potter's tool.</p>

<p>No clay worker's studio should be without a wheel,
but the particular form of wheel depends upon the
nature of the circumstances under which it is to be
employed.</p>

<p>The simplest wheel is that used by the Chinese. A
circular plate with a heavy rim is set upon a spindle
so that it will revolve freely and run steadily. As
the workman sits or kneels upon the floor the surface
of the wheel is about at the floor level. Around the
periphery and upon the upper surface four holes are
sunk and the workman, inserting a short stick into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
one of these, gives the wheel a rapid motion. Then
while it is revolving by its own momentum the clay
is centered and shaped. As the motion is lost the stick
is again inserted and the wheel spun. This method,
of course, involves much skill on the part of the workman.</p>

<p>In the next form, one which is only adapted, however,
for crude experimental work, the wheel is set
upon the frame of a sewing machine and operated by
the treadle. A beginning may be made upon such a
wheel but the operator will soon wish for something
better.</p>

<p>A common factory form and one which is well
adapted for studio work is the kick wheel. The wheel
head is set at the top of a spindle and in the upright
shaft there is a crank to which is attached a horizontal
moving treadle. This is worked continuously by
the left foot, the weight of the body being supported
by the right. The action is strenuous and scarcely
fitted for persons of other than robust physique but
it can be used successfully after practice. This wheel
is made by the manufacturers of potter's machinery.</p>

<p>Another form of the kick wheel is used in Europe
and is, in fact, the original wheel used by the French
and German potters in the seventeenth century. The
head is set on a spindle as usual but instead of the
crank there is a large heavy disc on the bottom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the shaft and revolving in a horizontal plane. This
is within reach of the foot and the operator, being
seated, imparts a rapid motion by pushing, usually
with the ball of the right toe. The momentum is kept
up by the weight of the disc and there is a great advantage
in that the foot need not be in continuous
motion. On the other hand it is difficult to acquire
sufficient speed and power for the work.</p>

<p>There are several forms of machine wheels which
are entirely satisfactory but which need the application
of power. If a gas engine or a water motor or electric
current be available, every effort should be made
to obtain a wheel of this description. The prime motion
is imparted to a short horizontal shaft which
moves at a constant speed. Then the operator, seated
in comfort, regulates the speed of the wheel itself
by pressure upon a treadle. No action is required but
a simple pressure, light for a slow speed and heavy
for rapidity. Where the electric current is available,
nothing could be better. Self-contained motor-driven
wheels are available but are rather expensive.</p>

<p>One more plan may be mentioned in which the
wheel is simply a vertical lathe with a belt and handle
to be turned by an assistant. This may be convenient
for some but it is not always possible to secure help
at the moment when the wheel is to be used. Moreover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the cost of labor would soon pay for a mechanical
wheel.<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_G' id='FNanchor_G' href='#Footnote_G'>[G]</a></p>

<p>Whatever type of wheel is selected it should be arranged
with a head which can be removed. There are
two methods of constructing this; the head may be
screwed on to the spindle, or the latter may terminate
in a cone-shaped plug upon which the wheel head is
made to fit as in the illustration (Fig. 14). The latter
plan is to be preferred as the head can be removed
more quickly and is not so likely to work loose. Several
heads for the wheel can then be provided, one
for regular work, one for making plates, one for finishing
and so forth.</p>

<p>The regular operation performed upon the wheel is
termed either throwing or turning according to the
industry in which it is employed, but in this description
the word "throwing" will be used because the subsequent
operation in which tools are employed is best
described as turning.</p>

<p>The best head for the wheel to be used in throwing
is made of hard wood or brass because the ball of
clay can be easily centered upon a smooth surface.
This, however, involves that the work shall be cut off
with a wire and removed while soft. This is commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
done by professionals but is beyond the skill of
the beginner. It is best, therefore, to use a head like
that illustrated for plate making and to have a number
of specially shaped plaster bats to fit the recess
(Fig. 17). Then when the piece is formed, the bat
with its burden can be set aside for the work to
harden.</p>

    alt='Fig. 17.' title='Fig. 17.' />
  <p><span class='sc'>Fig. 17.</span>  Wheel head with detached bat.</p>
</div>

<p>Throwing is not an easy operation to describe but
the following instructions in the form of lessons will,
with a large amount of practice, enable the student to
become fairly expert. Every opportunity should be
taken to watch a good potter at work. There are a
thousand and one little tricks in the position of the
arms, hands, thumbs and fingers which are impossible
to describe but which can easily be copied. If a kick
wheel be used some time must be given to practicing
the motion without using clay. The action of the foot
must become subconscious or automatic like the pedaling
of a bicycle so that simply to will a change of
speed is to accomplish it.</p>

  <p><span class='sc'>Fig. 18.</span>  The progress of a clay ball on the wheel.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Lesson I.</i> Take the bat about to be used, plunge
it in clean water and soak it nearly, but not quite, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
saturation. If the bat remain wet one minute after
being taken from the water, it has soaked too long and
must be dried off a little. The effect of a wet bat is
that the clay slips and cannot be held in one place.
The proper dampness is secured when the clay ball
can be pushed along the surface of the bat but does
not slip easily. This condition is important and should
be secured by experiment, because if not right, good
work will be impossible.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Lesson II.</i> Place a small basin of water close at
hand. Take a ball of clay about three inches in diameter.
Set it on the center of the wheel as nearly as
can be judged. Now spin the wheel at a fairly rapid
rate. Brace the left elbow against the side and, wetting
the hand, press the ball of the thumb and the
lower part of the palm against the clay. The left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
forearm being kept rigid, the clay as it revolves will
be forced into the center of the wheel. Use the right
hand to sprinkle water on the clay that proper lubrication
may be maintained. With the fingers of the
right hand pull the clay towards you, at the same time
pressing inward with left hand and so squeezing the
clay. As the hands come together the clay will rise
in a cone. Do not pull it upwards but let it rise
as it is squeezed. Now bring the hands over the top
and with the thumbs together press down again.
Lumps and irregularities will be felt in the clay and
the operations of spinning up and pressing down must
be continued until these disappear. Repeat the exercise
of centering with a fresh ball of clay until it
can be accomplished with ease and rapidity. The clay
so used is not wasted. The superfluous water may be
dried off upon a plaster bat and the clay wedged up
for use again.</p>

<div class='image' id='plate-iii'>

      alt='PLATE III.' title='PLATE III.' /></a>
  <p>PLATE III. <span class='sc'>Throwing.&mdash;Lesson</span> II, 3.</p>
</div>

<p>This wedging or waging of clay&mdash;the word has descended
from the old English potters&mdash;is important.
A strong table should be built of which the top, measuring
about 30 by 20 inches, is made of two-inch
plank. A raised edge two inches high is fastened
firmly by being nailed to the sides; the trough thus
formed is then filled with plaster and allowed to
harden. An upright post is fastened in the center of
one side and from the top of this a fine brass wire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
is stretched to the other side of the table, thus making
a diagonal. The worker stands at the side of the
table opposite the post. The ball of clay is taken in
both hands and cut in two against the wire, then the
pieces are slapped smartly upon the plaster, one on
top of the other. The whole lump is then lifted, cut
in two and slapped down as before. The lump of
clay is thus formed into layers, the irregularities in
hardness are corrected and the clay made smooth.
A little practice will make the work quite easy but it
will often be found necessary to cut and beat the clay
fifteen or twenty times before a good texture is secured.
If the plaster table be dry the clay will be
stiffened rapidly but the plaster may be made wet to
prevent this if it should not be necessary. A clay
may also be softened in this way by sprinkling it with
water as the wedging goes on.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Lesson III.</i> Center the ball as in Lesson II and
moisten both hands and the clay. Grasping the clay
lightly but with sufficient force, press the right thumb
downwards and towards the palm and a cup-shaped
hollow is formed in the clay. Raise the right hand
slowly, still keeping a light pressure upon the clay
with the thumb. The clay wall will rise with the
hand. Now insert the two first fingers of the left
hand into the hollow and hold them against the right-hand
wall. Slacken the speed of the wheel a little.
Bend the forefinger of the right hand and press the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
second joint and the knuckle against the outer wall
so as to oppose the fingers which are inside. Press
the thumbs together to steady the hands and raise both
hands upwards together. The fingers inside and outside
the clay should be kept at a definite distance
apart so that as the hands rise, the clay is brought
to a uniform thickness. The hands are brought steadily
to the full height to which the clay will go and
thus a cylinder is formed.</p>

<p>Repeat this lesson three or four times with fresh clay.</p>

<div class='image' id='plate-vi'>

</div>

<p><i>Lesson IV.</i> Keep the hands wet. Shape the clay
cylinder as directed in the previous exercise. Now
repeat the action of the fingers inside and outside
and, beginning at the bottom, take a closer grip of the
clay and draw up the walls as before. The cylinder
is now taller and the walls thinner. Do this again
and again taking a little closer grip each time until
the cylinder is as tall and as thin as the clay will bear.
The walls will probably spread as the work proceeds
and the hands must then be used outside. Grasp
the clay with both hands and squeeze it slightly; at
the same time raise the hands upwards. This will
reduce the diameter of the cylinder and thicken the
walls. The operation of the fingers can then be repeated
until the full height is reached. There is, of
course, a limit to the height of the cylinder which
can be made from a given lump of clay and it is best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to begin on a small scale. A ball of clay which can
be easily grasped with the hands is the proper size
with which to learn. A very small ball is nearly as
hard to work as a large one. Repeat this lesson until
a tall cylinder can be made with ease and certainty.</p>

<p><i>Lesson V.</i> Keep the hands wet. Spin up a cylinder
with thick walls as in Lesson III. With the fingers
of the one hand inside and those of the other
hand outside, open the cylinder gradually. Keep the
wheel at a slow speed. If the edge runs unevenly,
use both hands outside to steady it, then work outwards
again until a shallow bowl is formed.</p>

<p><i>Lesson VI.</i> Keep the hands wet. Spin up a cylinder
of medium height as in Lesson IV. With the
fingers of the right hand outside press inwards at the
base of the cylinder close to the bat and with the
fingers of the left hand inside, press outwards at a
slightly higher level. This will reduce the diameter
at the bottom and increase it in the middle, making
a cup shape. Now raise the right hand and gently
draw the top inwards. With the left hand inside
press the upper edge outward and with the fingers
of the right hand shape the upper part into the form
of a jar or flower pot.</p>

draw it gradually inwards into a globe form.
Work the clay carefully upwards and inwards until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the opening at the top is almost closed. Several attempts
will probably have to be made before this result

</div>

<p><i>Lesson VIII.</i> Keep the hands wet. Spin up a
globe shape with a narrow base as in Lesson VI but
carry a good share of the clay to the top so that the
upper edge of the globe is quite thick. Insert two
fingers of the left hand and with the fingers of the
right hand outside work the upper edge of the globe
into a tall neck. The action is the same as in the
shaping of a cylinder except that the diameter is
smaller. A good deal of practice will be necessary in
order to keep the neck thin and to raise it to any
appreciable height, but perseverance will accomplish it.</p>

  <p>PLATE XIII.  <span class='sc'>Throwing.&mdash;Lesson</span> VIII, 2.</p>
</div>

<p>These lessons if carried out conscientiously will enable
the operator to produce almost any form in so
far as the manipulation of the clay is concerned but
the work up to this point is drill only. It is not
intended that the pieces should be preserved. The
next point is to insist that the clay obey the potter
in the shaping of a form.</p>

<p>A simple drawing of a jar should be made exact
to the size proposed. Two or three pairs of calipers
are provided and with them the diameter of each
part of the drawing is taken. Of course a single
pair could be made to serve, but it is very inconvenient
to change measurements while working. A piece of
wood also is cut to the height of the proposed piece.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
The throwing is begun as usual by making a cylinder.
This should be higher than the drawing for the clay
sinks in the shaping. First the bottom is pressed into
the proper size (Lesson VI). Then the body is
enlarged to the required measure and, lastly the diameter
of the top is taken and the height brought to
the determined point. If too high the superfluous
clay may be cut off with a pointed knife, the edge
being carefully rounded afterwards.</p>

<p>It is only by checking up one's work in some such
way as this that real power can be acquired. The
skilled worker can think in the clay and create forms
at will upon the moving wheel, but for the beginner
to attempt this is like an endeavor to paint pictures
before one has learned to draw. Shape after shape
should be designed, drawn to scale and thrown to
measure; in fact, for elaborate pieces no other course
is possible.</p>

CHAPTER X<br />
<span class='exp'>Turning</span>
</h2>

<p>It is not possible to finish work to perfection in
the operation of throwing. The clay is too soft
to handle and for proper finishing the piece must be
turned over to get at the bottom. An experienced
thrower reduces the final work to a minimum and
this, of course, is the ideal plan but even in factory
practice every thrown piece is passed on to the turner
so that the phrase "thrown and turned" is used as
of a single operation, though it, in fact, expresses
not only two processes but the work of two men.</p>

<p>The artist-potter must needs, therefore, learn to
turn, though this process should not be worked to
death as it is liable to be. Many persons in the pride
of having produced some sort of a form on the wheel
will leave it in the crudest possible condition and
trust to the turning tool to remove defects. If the
lessons on throwing have been conscientiously carried
out, this error will not be committed.</p>

<p>A half dozen cylinders of convenient size should
be thrown on separate bats and set aside in a cool
place to harden. They must not be dried but should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
be in the condition known as "leather hard." If
thrown one day they will be ready for turning the
next morning. Pieces thus hardened are no longer
flexible. They can be handled freely and the clay
can be easily cut with a knife.</p>

  <p><span class='sc'>Fig. 19.</span>  Turning tools bent and sharpened.</p>
</div>

<p>The equipment for turning consists of a board support,
a turning stick and a set of tools. The board is
of soft pine, eight or ten inches wide and two feet
high and is set upright at the back of the wheel frame
opposite the workman. It may be screwed in position
if it does not interfere with the throwing, or it
may be set in a socket so as to be removed when not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in use. Its purpose is to support the end of the turning
stick. The stick is an ordinary broomstick in
the end of which is a sharpened nail. In use the end
of the stick is held in the left hand and the point is
pressed into the board at any required height. The
right hand, holding the tool, is rested on the stick
just as the hand of a painter rests on the mahl-stick.</p>

<p>The turning tools are of soft steel.<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_H' id='FNanchor_H' href='#Footnote_H'>[H]</a> They are
purchased unshaped and the potter must learn to bend
and file them to suit himself. A section of bench
should be set apart for filing and care must be taken
that the steel dust does not get into the clay.</p>

<p>One of the cylinders, with the bat upon which it
was thrown, is now taken in hand. Many beginners
try to turn their pieces without detaching them from
the bat, trusting to the original adhesion to hold the
piece in position. This is a very unsatisfactory plan.
A fundamental principle in craft work is that the
mechanical difficulties in manipulation should be met
and overcome at the first. If one trusts to some
method which is apparently easy one walks with
crutches and there will come a time, if progress is to
be made, when such helps must of necessity be abandoned
and then the learning must be begun again.
Therefore the student is advised to face the mechanical
technique at the very beginning. The cylinder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
may be turned on the throwing bat, but there is a
better way.</p>

<p>The piece should not become so hard that it will
release its hold on the bat but with a long bladed
knife it should be cut away. If the knife be held close
to the bat a separation is easily effected. Set the
leather-hard cylinder upon a new bat which is slightly
damp and which runs true, on the wheel. The first
problem is to center the work. A pencil line may be
run upon the bat making a circle just the size of the
cylinder. Then as the wheel is revolved it will be
seen if the piece runs true. It is quite unlikely that
this will be the case. Perhaps the bottom is true but
the top circle is untrue. In other words, the axis of
the cylinder is not upright. Turn the cylinder upside
down and try if it will run any better. If it does the
work may be begun in this position. If it does not,
turn it back again. Now take a pencil and hold it
with a steady hand so that it just touches the near
side as the wheel goes round. Lift up the edge of
the cylinder on the side marked by the pencil and
slip a morsel of clay under it. Revolve the wheel
and try with the pencil again. In this way raise or
press down one side, keeping the bottom circle in
the center until both top and bottom are running as
nearly true as they can be made. This, so far, refers
only to the horizontal planes. If one side is higher
than the other it does not matter at present. Now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
take three small pieces of soft clay, and, holding the
cylinder firmly with one hand, press them down at
equidistant points in the angle where the piece joins
the bat. This serves to hold the work in position.
A square turning tool of small size is the best to
begin with. It is held in the fingers as a pen is held
but more firmly. The right hand rests on the turning
stick and, the connection between hand and stick being
as rigid as possible, both are moved together.
This is better at first than moving the right hand
freely for to do so will surely result in irregular work.</p>

<p>The tool should be held so as to cut with one corner
at first and it is well to take one cut, remove the tool,
take another cut and so on. The object should be to
feel the clay and to test its resistance. No one can
be a successful potter who does not cultivate a sympathy
for the clay. The tool is to cut, not to scrape.
That is, the cutting edge is to be opposed to the revolving
clay. The point at which the tool touches the
clay is opposite the center or at the same distance
from the operator as the center of the wheel is. If
nearer to the workman the tool will not cut; if further
away, it will scrape and pull (Fig. 5, page 50).</p>

<p>The first efforts should be directed towards acquiring
skill. The student should endeavor to make a
cut at any desired point without regarding the effect
upon the shape of the cylinder. In other words the
clay is used merely as a practice piece. It is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to be preserved. It is a good plan to keep on turning
the first piece until it is all turned away. Too many
students fail because they wish to have a piece to
keep. He will make the best ultimate success who
cares nothing for the preservation of a dozen or two
cylinders or other shapes, but uses them merely as
exercises in manipulation. If the student is over anxious
to avoid spoiling his work, he grows nervous
and so loses control of his tools and material. To
set no value on the practice pieces themselves begets
confidence and this is the surest aid to success.</p>

<p>After two or three cylinders have been centered
to the pencil line the attempt to center one free-hand
may be made. Place a cylinder on the wheel but
not quite in the center. Spin the wheel at a medium
rate. Fix the attention upon the eccentric motion,
trying to forget the circular motion. As the cylinder
appears to move from side to side tap it lightly
with the hand so as to drive it towards the center.
In all probability this will result in driving the cylinder
off the wheel altogether. Some little practice
is needed, but if persevered in the result will be a
power of convenient and rapid centering which is
never forgotten and which is the greatest possible
help to successful work. One may practice with a
wooden cylinder or even a tin can if the weight approximates
that of the clay pieces.</p>

</div>

<p>Accompanying the practice in turning there should
be some exercise in the shaping and filing of tools.
Broad tools filed to the proper curve are indispensable
in finishing concave surfaces. A curved edge may
also be put upon one or two narrow tools. These
will cut more rapidly than the broader ones but will
not leave as smooth a finish. Whatever tool be used
the final surface must be worked over with a soft
sponge and water so as to eliminate the tool marks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and leave a plastic surface. One of the principal
troubles with which the beginner will meet is the vibration
of the tool known as "chattering." This is
sometimes so slight as not to be felt by the hand but
when the motion of the wheel is stopped the work
will be found covered with fine ridges like gathering
on muslin. The way to prevent this is to avoid using
the broad edge of the tool until some experience has
been gained. The way to cure it is to go over the
work again with a fine pointed tool and then to use
the sponge liberally. The point of the tool cuts
through the small ribs or wrinkles whereas a broad
tool would ride over them and make the trouble worse.</p>

<p>While the whole surface of the work will probably
need more or less turning, the chief part of the operation
is concerned with the under part or foot.
The formation of a good foot marks a good potter
and vice versa. Before beginning to turn it should
be decided what kind of a foot is desired. Each
shape has its own style. Some sketches are given
here with an idea of the form to which each is adapted.
They are shown upside down because the work
is done in this position. The small bevel at the outer
angle is used for facility in glazing. A foot finished
thus always has a neat appearance when the glaze
has been removed from the beveled face.</p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_XI'>
CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class='exp'>Making Large Pieces</span>
</h2>


<p>There is a limit in size beyond which the non-professional
will not be able to go. Men of
life-long experience can throw very large jars but this
involves not only more practice than the artist-potter
can hope to secure but also great physical strength.
On the other hand it is perfectly possible to form
vases two or three feet in height by doing the work
in parts or sections. No one need fear to put such
a plan in operation on account of sentiment. It is,
of course, worth while to make large wares in a
single piece but section work involves great skill and,
as a rule, the result attained is better. Work made
in one piece is apt to be badly finished, especially inside,
and unduly heavy. Work made in sections can
be thrown with thin walls and finished with proper
care. If tradition be of any help, be it known that
the Chinese have used the piece method for hundreds
of years, and that the Greeks used it three thousand
years ago.</p>

<p>The first requisite is a drawing either actual size
or properly scaled. The measurements should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
those of the soft clay and if a particular size be desired
in the burned piece, the shrinkage, probably
about one-eighth, must be added. The drawing must
show the size of each section with the points of junction,
and should indicate the upper and lower edges
in each case. Some divisions are best made right side
up; some are more easily thrown upside down. Care
should be taken that the faces which are to be joined
are thrown under similar conditions. In every piece
of work one face rests on the bat, the other is in the
air or free. A bat face should always be joined to
a bat face and a free face to a free.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, a vase is to be sixteen inches
high and is to be thrown in four divisions of four
inches each. The bottom division is made first. This
will stand in its normal position, right side up. The
second section must now be thrown upside down,
because, if it were not, its bat face would be joined
to the free face of the first piece. So the sections are
thrown alternately, every other one being inverted.</p>

<div class='image' id='plate-xiv'>
  <a href='images/plate-xivh.jpg'>
    <img src='images/plate-xiv.jpg'
      alt='PLATE XIV.' title='PLATE XIV.' /></a>
  <p>PLATE XIV.  <span class='sc'>Making Large Pieces. The First Section.</span></p>
</div>

<p>As the pieces are thrown they must be carefully
measured to see that the faces which are to be united
are the same size. The height of each piece also must
be gauged and adjusted. The bats with their contents
are now set aside to harden. As soon as they can
be handled with safety the clay pieces should be removed
from the bats upon which the throwing was
done and set upon dry bats which will absorb the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
moisture and help to stiffen the clay. It is a good
plan to pile the sections up as they are to stand in
the finished piece, one upon another and to leave them
so in a cool place for ten or twelve hours. The faces
which are to be joined will thus acquire a uniform
hardness and unequal shrinkage will be avoided.</p>

<p>When all is ready for the turning, the sections being
of the proper hardness are taken in hand. This
work should not be hurried. It will take a whole
morning to put together a large piece. First, the
bottom section is placed on the wheel, centered and
made to run true as regards the top edge. It is then
inverted and the foot is properly finished, signed and
dated. Then the second joint is likewise turned true
on both faces, the inside turned smooth; and so on,
each piece in turn is prepared for the fitting, the
measurement of each face being accurately adjusted.
At this stage it is possible to correct the diameter of
the faces to some extent either by pressure as the
wheel revolves or by building up with soft clay. In
either case, however, the new work must be hardened
before proceeding. The whole piece is now put together
carefully but with dry joints. It should be
slowly revolved on the wheel and the proportions carefully
criticised. If satisfactory it is taken apart again
and the actual fitting up may proceed.</p>

<p>The bottom section is again centered most carefully
on the wheel and steadied with three pieces of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
clay. A thick slip is now prepared, the same clay as
that used for the work being of course, used. This
slip must be quite free from lumps and should be as
thick as molasses. The upper edge of the work is
carefully sponged with clean water and a good coating
of slip is applied at the junction. Care must be
taken that every part of the face is covered with slip.
The second joint is now moistened at the junction
and set in position upon the bed of slip. It is placed
very lightly and the wheel is gently revolved to see
if the running is true. If so it is pressed home and
the superfluous slip is removed. The joint should be
quite close like a glued joint in carpentry.</p>

<p>In the same way the third section is placed upon
the second and the fourth upon the third. It is now
possible to work over the face of the vase with a
little soft clay. There is almost always some irregularity
in the line, especially at the joints, and this
must be adjusted while the work is moist. Then the
whole face is gone over with turning tools and sponge
and the vase is set aside to dry. It must not be
expected that large pieces, made by any method, will
be produced with as much ease as small vases and
bowls. The risks are much greater and, owing to
the size of the work, the faults are much more apparent.
When the vase is perfectly dry it should be
set on the wheel, centered and slowly revolved. If it
is very untrue in its motion there is no remedy. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
should be broken down and the clay used again. A
very slight irregularity may be corrected by rubbing
off a little clay on one side of the foot but this cannot
be done to any considerable extent. The courage to
break unsatisfactory work is never more valuable than
at this juncture. It will pay in the end, for no imperfect
piece can be a source of satisfaction to the
conscientious craftsman.</p>

CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class='exp'>Cups and Saucers and Plates</span>
</h2>


<p>It is not likely that many craftsmen will care to
produce table wares or even that they will be
able to acquire the necessary skill. Simple as these
wares seem, they are, in fact, the most difficult of all
to make well. In factory working, one man makes
nothing but cups, another saucers and another plates,
so that each attains the skill of constant practice, but
this is out of the question for the studio worker. At
the same time it is well to know how it is done and
it may be that some one will undertake to produce a
few pieces for the sake of the enjoyment arising therefrom.</p>

<p>It is possible to finish a cup upon the wheel just
as a vase is made. The handle is modeled in clay
and fastened in place with slip when in the leather
hard condition. Saucers and plates cannot be made
in this manner; first, because the broad thin bottom
will surely crack and, second, because it is impracticable
to turn a plate or saucer over in order to finish
the bottom. The risk of breakage is so great that
there is nothing to be gained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>If cups be needed of uniform size they must be
molded. The making of the molds has already been
described. A small cylinder of the proper size is
thrown in clay and removed from the wheel while
soft. A number of these should be made at one time
so as to avoid changing the wheel head often. When
all are ready a hollow head shaped to receive the
cup mold is set on the wheel and a mold inserted.
One of the soft cylinders is now lowered gently into
the mold and as the wheel is revolved the soft clay
is pressed firmly against the walls with the fingers.
A piece of wood, called a rib, cut to the exact shape
of the inside of the cup, is used to smooth off the
interior. The top edge is cut off and rounded and
the mold is set aside for the cup to harden. As
soon as the cup can be turned out it is set upside
down upon the wheel and the bottom turned.</p>

<p>Another method dispenses with the formation of the
cylinder or "lining." A ball of clay of the proper
size is dropped into the mold and pressed into shape
with the fingers, the wheel, of course, being spun.
The finishing is accomplished with the rib as before.
This method will answer for wares which are to receive
a low fire but for high temperatures the clay
must be handled by the first-named plan.</p>

<p>The cup is not complete without a handle. This
may be modeled as already stated but to make each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
one of half a dozen in this way is unduly tedious.
The better plan is to model a handle in wax and
make a mold as already directed. A roll of soft clay
is then laid in the mold, the two halves pressed together
and the handle taken out and finished. Care
must be taken that cup and handle are of the same
degree of moisture, leather hard, for choice, or they
will part company as they dry. The fastening is
done with thick slip.</p>

<p>The method for saucers is the same as that for
plates, so that one description will suffice. The first
step is to make a tool or profile. A large handful of
soft clay is rolled out into a thick cylinder and laid
down upon the plate mold. It should extend from
the center to the circumference, forming a radius of
the circle. The clay is pressed closely to the surface
of the mold and part of it is squeezed into a knob
which will form the hand-hold of the tool (Fig. 16,
page 66). The clay is left in this position until it
becomes nearly but not quite dry. It is then taken
off and whittled into shape. The front edge must
be straight and must lie along a radius of the plate.
The foot is cut in at the proper point and a broad
wedge-shaped hollow is made so as to gather the
clay and pile it up into the foot. The hand-hold is
shaped so as to fit comfortably between the first and
second fingers of the right hand. When properly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
shaped the tool is thoroughly dried and then burned
in the kiln. The fire must not be severe as it is important
not to shrink the tool to any great extent.
After burning slight corrections can be made with a
file or a hard stone. The heel of the profile must be
exactly at the center of the plate and the toe or curve
must rest on the outer edge of the plate mold.</p>

<p>In making plates a "batting block" and "batter"
are used. The former is a heavy block of plaster
which is fixed to a strong table. It must be saturated
with water when in use. The wedging table already
described will serve for this. The batter is a disc
of plaster to which a handle is attached. It may
be made of a thick plaster block, the handle being
cut out of the substance itself. This is also kept
saturated with water so that the clay will not stick.
A ball of clay is laid on the block and gently beaten
out with the batter into a disc of the proper size and
thickness. The face of this is then polished with a
steel blade and the disc is then lifted, turned over and
laid, polished side downward, upon the mold. The
wheel is then revolved and the clay pressed firmly to
the mold with wet hands. The tool is now dipped in
water and pressed steadily upon the revolving clay.
The heel must be adjusted accurately to the center
and the foot will be seen to rise up in its proper
place. The operation is not easy and many failures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
must be expected but practice will accomplish the
desired result. When leather hard the plate is gone
over with a thin piece of rubber and when quite hard
it may be removed from the mold. The edge is now
trimmed and the face sponged over and the plate is
ready for the kiln.</p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_XIII'>
CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class='exp'>Casting</span>
</h2>

<p>In commercial production the casting method is
constantly used. It is a means of making light
and delicate pieces with ease and, of course, all the
pieces cast in the same mold are alike. This very
fact, however, has led to the method being disregarded
by the studio worker who does not wish to duplicate
anything that he makes. If a single piece only is
to be made the work involved in molding is a waste
of time and it is better to strive for skill at the wheel,
and yet there are occasions when a knowledge of
casting is of great value. In the preparation of trial
pieces there is no method better. To make these in
sufficient number on the wheel would be tedious except
for the benefit of the practice involved.</p>

<p>Directions for making molds have already been
given and the slip which will have been prepared in
the process of clay making is ready for the casting
process. This slip should be thick, about the thickness
of buckwheat batter. To be accurate, a pint
should weigh 26 ounces. For small pieces or for
vases with narrow necks it is advisable to use the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
slip rather thinner. For large wares, on the other
hand, or for open bowls it may be slightly thicker. A
few experiments will show the reason for this. Two
quart jugs are needed. They should be large of neck
and should deliver their contents freely and completely.
Jugs with a deep shoulder are not good as the
slip hangs in the pouring. One of these jugs is filled
with slip which is to be poured carefully from one
to the other, allowing it to flow gently down the side.
This is to break the air bubbles which are nearly always
found to be present and the pouring should be
repeated until the slip flows smooth and even.</p>

<p>The mold, being thoroughly dry, is tied around with
twine, if in parts, and wedged firmly so that it cannot
leak. The slip is then carefully poured so as not to
touch the sides and the mold is filled until a small
mound of slip rises over the edge. This mound will
at once begin to sink as the water is drawn into the
walls of the mold and slip must be added, little by
little, to make good the loss. A small quantity of clay
will now be found to have stiffened at the rim of
the mold and if this be carefully removed with a steel
tool the thickness of the wall of the vase will be seen.
If not thick enough the mold must be continually
filled up until the necessary thickness is attained. The
mold is then carefully lifted, making sure that the
bottom is held firmly, and the slip is poured out. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
should not be poured back into the casting-jug but
into another vessel.</p>

<p>The mold is now set upside down to drain. It
should not be placed upon the table but upon two
sticks laid parallel so that the drip may hang clear.
Several molds may be filled in this way at one time
and after about twenty minutes the one first filled
may be opened. The bottom is gently detached and
the upper part of the mold, consisting of two halves,
is laid upon the table on its side. A little gentle
manipulation will now suffice to lift the one half and
the vase will be seen lying in the other half as in a
cradle. The clay is still very soft and must be treated
carefully. The half mold, with the contained vase, is
taken in the left hand and held nearly upright, the
fingers below, the thumb on the top. Now set the
fingers of the right hand under the bottom of the vase,
rest the thumb lightly against the side and tilt the
half mold gently forward. If mold and clay are in
good condition the vase will fall forward to be supported
on the fingers of the right hand and steadied
by the thumb. The half mold is now laid down and
the vase taken in both hands, set gently on a plaster
bat and put aside to dry. It often happens that the
vase leaves the mold with reluctance. If the slip be
very new, or the mold either damp or hard or worn
out there will be some difficulty in effecting a separation.
By allowing the work to stand a while, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and by slightly jarring the mold from time to
time with the ball of the thumb the piece can generally
be removed without damage.</p>

<p>In using a new mold it is customary to make what
is called a "waste filling." The mold is filled with
slip and at once emptied. After standing a few minutes
it is forcibly opened and the thin layer of clay
inside is picked out with a ball of plastic clay pressed
against it. A tool should never be used as this will
damage the face of the mold. If the clay should stick
obstinately a soft cloth used over the finger will remove
it. The reason for this waste filling is that it
removes the scum which occurs on all new molds.</p>

<p>Cast ware should not be touched until quite dry
and then the spare at the neck is carefully cut off,
the seams scraped down and the whole surface
smoothed with fine sand paper and a soft cloth.
Worn out linen serves excellently for this purpose.</p>

<p>Cups and bowls, if molded, are made without spare
at the top. In this case great care must be taken to
see that the edge is left clean and smooth in the
casting. The spare neck on a vase acts as a margin
of safety, as it is completely cut away in the finishing.
If a piece has no spare the edge must be
left without blemish at the first.</p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_XIV'>
CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class='exp'>Tiles</span>
</h2>

<p>There are two methods of making tiles, the
dust-pressed method and the plastic. The former
is the more usual commercial plan but the appliances
for preparing the dust and the heavy presses
necessary are not adapted to studio work. The dust-pressed
tile is, moreover, somewhat mechanical in
surface. It is not suitable for modeling or for any
treatment but those of glaze and color. The plastic
tile, on the other hand, may be treated by plastic
methods and the surface offers a texture which appeals
strongly to the artist.</p>

<p>For the successful production of tile a special body
is necessary. Ordinary pottery clay is too close in
grain and straight tile cannot be made from it. Small
square pieces, however, such as tesser&aelig;, can be made
from any clay.</p>

<p>It is presumed that a pure white tile body is not
required. For studio work the most pleasing white
surface is found in an opaque enamel, but for the
most part the craftsman will wish to work for colored
tile. A cream or buff body is all that is necessary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
therefore, and the foundation of this is a clay known
as sagger clay. In order to secure the necessary
porosity a fine "grog" must be used. Grog is burned
clay. After working awhile there will be an abundance
of this in broken unglazed pottery but at first
some soft fire-bricks must be pounded. This is laborious
work, but a boy can usually be hired to do it.
The brick or broken pottery is crushed in an iron
mortar but should not be broken too fine. Two sieves
are necessary, one of 20 and one of 40 meshes to the
linear inch. The coarse powder which passes through
the 20 mesh and lies upon the 40 mesh is used. This
is called 20-40 grog. The dust which passes through
the 40 mesh may be saved for kiln work. It is useful
for setting biscuit pieces one upon another as it
will effectually prevent sticking. This powdered grog
is also useful in the case of flowing glazes. A thick
layer on the bottom of the kiln will catch any drops
of glaze and save the kiln from damage.</p>

<p>A quantity of the 20-40 grog having been prepared,
a mixture should be made of:&mdash;</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Sagger Clay</td><td>550 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>20-40 Grog </td><td>300 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ground Flint</td><td>150 parts</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The clay should be finely pulverized and the whole
mixed in the dry state. Water is then added, little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
by little, until a rather soft mass is obtained. It is
not practicable to mix clay of this description by the
slip method because the grog would settle out and
fall to the bottom of the vessel. It sometimes happens,
however, that the stoneware clay contains grains
of iron which cause black spots to appear in the tile.
If these cause trouble the clay must be made into
slip first and lawned through 120 mesh. It is then
allowed to become very thick and the grog is stirred
in. This is a good deal more trouble than the first
named plan and is not often necessary.</p>

<p>Tile are sometimes made in plaster molds. A tile
of the proper size is cut from a plaster block and a
mold is made from it. If a modeled surface be desired
clay may be modeled upon the face of the plaster
tile before the mold is made. The mold will then
receive the embossment in reverse and all the tiles
made from this mold will be alike. The clay is
pressed into the mold while quite soft and is scraped
off level at the back. Thus it is the face of the tile
that is shaped by the plaster. If this plan be adopted
the tile must be removed from the mold as soon as
possible. If left to dry in the mold they will warp
because of the unequal absorption.</p>

<p>A better method has been devised by the author
and has been put into practice with considerable success.
When the size of the proposed tile has been
determined a board is made which is large enough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to hold a square of the tile, say twelve or sixteen.
Thus if a tile five inches square is to be made the
board would be fifteen by twenty inches for twelve
tile or twenty inches square for sixteen. On each
side of the board a wooden rim is fastened and this
must stand higher than the board to the exact thickness
of the tile. About five-eighths of an inch is
enough. The board must be perfectly rectangular and
marked off at even distance of five inches and a shallow
groove is cut at each point.</p>

<p>To make the tile the board is wetted and an even
coating of grog dust is sprinkled upon it. A ball of
clay is laid in the center of the board and rolled out
with a rolling pin to fill every part of the frame.
With a straight edge the clay is struck off smooth
and clean, working always from the center outwards.
Reversing the plaster mold method the tile are now
face upward and any kind of surface may be given
at will. The clay may be lubricated with water and
made smooth or it may be sprinkled with grog dust
which will give a sandy or toothed finish. The square
is now to be cut into tile and this is done with a
slender knife and ruler. The ruler should not rest
upon the clay but upon thin strips of wood or cardboard
which may be laid along the edges for the purpose.
The cutting should not go quite through the
clay as, if a slight connection be allowed to remain at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the bottom, the tile will keep each other straight.
When the cutting is finished the board should be set
at an angle of forty-five degrees for the clay to harden.
When leather-hard the whole may be turned gently
over and the tile allowed to fall on to a board placed
in readiness. They are now broken apart, trimmed
if necessary and set aside to dry.</p>

<p>Tile made in this way can be kept straight without
difficulty and the method is much more expeditious
than pressing in plaster molds.</p>

<p>If a modeled surface be intended it is quite easy
to work on the tile in the tray while the clay is soft.
Forms may be cut in wood and pressed into the clay
in any variety and the charm of individual treatment
is preserved.</p>

<p>The body given above will prove quite porous when
fired but it will take matt glazes well. A little crazing
is no detriment to tile because they are not like vessels
which are meant to hold water. If a denser body be
wished for some of the flint may be replaced by spar.</p>

<p>One of the most attractive methods of decorating
tile is by means of a white or delicately tinted enamel
and color. The opaque tin enamel given on page 134
will answer well and if the whiteness prove too intense
it may be modified by a very small addition of
under-glaze color according to the tint desired. The
tile should be glazed rather thick. Not as thick as a
matt glaze but thicker than bright glazes. The glaze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
or enamel should be poured into a flat tray which
is large enough to receive one tile. The tile is taken
by the edges between fingers and thumb and held face
downwards. Do not let either fingers or thumb project
beyond the face. The glaze having been well
stirred the face of the tile is allowed to rest upon it
for about two seconds. The hand is then lifted quickly
and reversed so that the tile is face upwards. Every
effort should be made to avoid streaks or tears and a
little practice will accomplish this. If the glaze shows
a bad surface it should be scraped off. It can be
mixed up and used again. Sometimes a slight wetting
of the tile before glazing will help the surface to
flow evenly.</p>

<p>The decoration is carried out with ordinary under-glaze
colors. These may be mixed together to produce
any hue which is sought and a little of the glaze
itself, about ten per cent., should be mixed with the
color. This will assist in uniting the color with the
glaze so that they melt together.</p>

<p>To produce enamel decorations at their true value
the color should be painted upon the dry glaze before
it is burned. The best relation between surface and
color is thus secured. The color must be worked quite
thin with water and a little glycerine. A quick, sure
stroke is needed as no change or erasure is possible.
The design may be made on paper and traced or
pounced on to the glaze with lamp-black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>For burning the tile there is nothing better than
little fire-clay boxes. These can be made in a mold
without difficulty and the inside of each should be
washed with glaze. If some such protection be not
provided dirt is almost sure to fall on the flat surface
and the tile will be spoiled. It is not possible to
rear them on edge in the kiln for burning as then
the glaze would flow to the lower side and cause an
unsightly ridge.</p>

CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class='exp'>Glazes and Glazing</span>
</h2>

<h3>PART I</h3>

<p>Much of the fascination of pottery making centers
in the glaze. At one time a great deal of
mystery appeared to surround the composition and
use of glazes, but if one will take the trouble to learn,
much of this may be dispelled. Some knowledge of
chemistry is desirable if an understanding of the
theory of glaze-making is to be acquired, but a good
deal may be learned even without this knowledge.
Only such simple instruction as can be assimilated by
ordinary intelligence will be attempted here, as an
exhaustive treatment of the subject would be long and
tedious.</p>

<p>It is possible to purchase glazes ready for use<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_J' id='FNanchor_J' href='#Footnote_J'>[J]</a> but
the true craftsman will not be satisfied until he can
prepare his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Glazes<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_K' id='FNanchor_K' href='#Footnote_K'>[K]</a> belong to a class of chemical compounds
known as silicates; that is, they have silica as the
characteristic ingredient. Clear glazes are compound
silicates of lead, zinc, lime, potassium, sodium, aluminum
and boron. Matt glazes are characterized by
certain of these ingredients being present in excess;
and stanniferous or tin glazes are, as the name implies,
rendered opaque by the use of oxide of tin.</p>

<p>The commonest type of glaze is that which is made
from ready prepared, commercial substances. These
are called raw glazes as being made from raw materials
or materials which need no preparation.</p>

<p>It is possible to mix a glaze in a druggist's mortar
by hand, using fine sieves, but if the best results are
to be secured, a small mill must be used for grinding.
The best form of mill is the ball mill or jar mill.
This consists of a porcelain jar which is set in a
frame and made to revolve upon its axis in a horizontal
position. It is about half filled with porcelain
balls and these as they roll against each other perform
the grinding. These mills may be purchased ready
for use, either as a single jar to be worked by hand
or a battery of two or more revolved by power.<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_L' id='FNanchor_L' href='#Footnote_L'>[L]</a></p>

<p>A good pair of scales is a necessity and it will be
found convenient to use metric weights which need
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
no calculation into pounds and ounces. Suspended
scales are not as easy to use as the form known as
counter scales or balances. They should have movable
pans which are usually nickel plated. Upon these
the materials can be placed direct without the use of
pieces of paper, which are always troublesome and inaccurate.
There should be a graduated bar on the front
for the adjustment of weights of five grams and under.
This avoids the use of small weights which are
always being mislaid and lost. Dealers in chemical
supplies keep these scales in stock and the cost is
about eight dollars. A set of weights must also be
procured from one hundred grams to five grams inclusive.
These need not be of the accurate adjustment
which are used in analysis. A good inexpensive grade
is sufficient.</p>

<p>The ingredients for glazes are given in the following
list:</p>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>For coloring, the following metallic oxides are used:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Color</td><td>Chemical Name</td><td>Symbol or Formula</td><td>Equivalent Weight</td></tr>
<tr><td>Blue</td><td>Cobalt Oxide</td><td>CoO</td><td>80</td></tr>

<tr><td>Brown</td><td>Manganese Carbonate</td><td>MnCO<span class='sub'>3</span></td><td>115</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Under-glaze colors may also be used for coloring
glazes, the color being ground with the glaze batch.</p>

<p>It is not absolutely necessary to commit the formula
and equivalent weight to memory. They will soon be
remembered as use becomes second nature.</p>

<p>A glaze is usually expressed as the chemical formula.
In this there are three divisions given, each of which
expresses a distinct function. On the left hand are
the bases, the foundation of the glaze. These indicate
the type, such as lead glaze, a lime glaze, an
alkaline glaze, etc. All glazes being silicates, this is
the usual way of distinguishing them. In the center
are the alumina and boron oxide. These regulate the
behavior of the glaze in the fire. They make it viscous
or sluggish as it melts and prevent a too rapid flow.
The alumina is infusible, the boron is fusible, but
boron cannot be used in a raw glaze for reasons to
be presently explained. At the right stands the silica,
the dominating factor with which all the other ingredients
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
combine, and which controls the behavior of
the whole as regards the fitting of the glaze to the
body.</p>

<p>The very simplest form of glaze is a bisilicate of
lead, represented by the formula PbO, SiO<span class='sub'>2</span>, or one
equivalent of lead oxide and one of silica. The term
"equivalent" means that the mixture is calculated,
not upon the actual weight of a substance but upon its
equivalent or unit weight. Thus the equivalent weight
of lead oxide, PbO, being 222, in order to produce the
formula in actual weight 222 grams or pounds must
be weighed out. It does not matter what weights are
used so long as they are the same for all.</p>

<p>In like manner the equivalent weight of silica is 60
and as flint is pure silica, the formula PbO, SiO<span class='sub'>2</span>
would be produced by weighing&mdash;</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Litharge or Lead Oxide</td><td>222 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flint or Silica</td><td>60 parts</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Litharge is not, however, a convenient substance to
use. It is very heavy and does not mix well in water.
The most usual substance for the introduction of lead
oxide is white lead. This is not lead oxide but it
changes to lead oxide when burned. White lead bears
the formula Pb(OH)<span class='sub'>2</span>, 2PbCO<span class='sub'>3</span>, which, being dissected
is found to be 3PbO, H<span class='sub'>2</span>O, 2CO<span class='sub'>2</span>. H<span class='sub'>2</span>O is
water and CO<span class='sub'>2</span> carbonic acid, both of which pass off
in burning. Both, however, are weighed when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
white lead is put on the scales and therefore the
equivalent weight of white lead is 258 and not 222.</p>

<p>The mixture for practical purposes then would be&mdash;</p>

<table>
<tr><td>White Lead</td><td>258 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flint</td><td>60 parts</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Which, when ground and spread upon the ware would
be a very fusible glaze of a yellowish tone.</p>

<p>This was spoken of as a bisilicate of lead because
the measure of the silica, also called the acidity of a
glaze, is calculated upon the oxygen contained in the
base and the silica respectively. PbO contains one
molecule of oxygen, SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> contains two. Hence the
relationship of the oxygen in the base to the oxygen
in the silica is as one to two. This is called simply
the "oxygen ratio" and is of great importance in determining
the behavior of a glaze. While this simple
bisilicate of lead will be a glaze under certain conditions
it is found to possess two faults. 1. It is too
fluid under fire. The glaze will run down a vertical
surface and leave the upper edge of the piece bare.
2. If subjected to a long slow fire it will lose its gloss
and become devitrified. This devitrification is often
seen in commercial work and appears as a dull scum
in patches and around the edges of the ware. It is,
in fact, a crystallization of the silica which separates
out, as salt does from an evaporated brine. Both these
faults may be corrected by the addition of a little
alumina to the glaze. A whole equivalent of alumina
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
would be too much, in fact it is found in practice that
.2 equivalent is sufficient for most lowfire glazes. In
order to maintain the oxygen ratio and to keep the
glaze as a bisilicate the silica content must be raised.
Alumina contains three molecules of oxygen so that
the total amount of alumina is multiplied by three and
the silica brought to the equal point thus:</p>
<p class='formula'>
PbO, .2Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span>, 1.6SiO<span class='sub'>2</span>
</p>
<p>The amount of silica required in any bisilicate glaze
may be found by the following equation:</p>

<p class='formula'>
SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> = 2(3Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span> + 1)&nbsp;/&nbsp;2
</p>
<p>Thus if the alumina content were .25 equivalent this
would be expressed:</p>

<p class='formula'>
SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> = 2(.75 + 1)&nbsp;/&nbsp;2
</p>

<p>Or&mdash;</p>

<p class='formula'>
SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> = 3.50&nbsp;/&nbsp;2 = 1.75 equivalent
</p>

<p>Now in order to produce this as a mixture it would
be possible to introduce the alumina in the pure state,
but pure alumina is expensive and clay which contains
alumina is cheap so that clay is generally used to supply
the alumina. Clay, however, contains silica as well,
and therefore allowance must be made for this. On
referring to the formula for kaolin, the purest form
of clay, Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span>, 2SiO<span class='sub'>2</span>, 2H<span class='sub'>2</span>O, it will be seen that there
is twice as much silica present in equivalence as there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
is alumina and therefore .2 kaolin will contain .2Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span>
and 4SiO<span class='sub'>2</span>. Subtracting, then, the 4SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> from the
1.6SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> needed there will be 1.2 left to be supplied in
the form of flint. The mixture therefore is&mdash;</p>

<table>
<tr><td>White Lead</td><td>1.0 &times; 258 = 258</td></tr>
<tr><td>Kaolin</td><td>.2 &times; 258 = 51.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flint</td><td>1.2 &times; 60 = 72</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This is a glaze of the same character as that first
given except that it no longer flows unduly from the
higher places nor will it devitrify in a long-continued
fire. The alumina will have counteracted both these evils.</p>

<p>A glaze with only lead oxide as the base is not,
however, desirable for general use. The color is yellowish
and the lead oxide is apt to destroy the hue
of any colors which are used with it. The available
bases may be classified under three heads. 1. The
metallic oxides, lead and zinc oxides. 2. The alkaline
earths, the oxides of calcium and barium. 3. The
alkalies, potash and soda. Barium oxide is not often
used and soda cannot be used in raw glazes because
there is no convenient substance which contains it.
As glazes are always ground in water only insoluble
ingredients can be employed without preparation. Potash
is found in feldspar which is insoluble and while
there is a so-called soda feldspar it can rarely be obtained
of sufficient purity.</p>

<p>In arranging the bases with which to compose a
glaze it is desirable to use one at least from each
class, but it must be borne in mind that however many
bases are introduced the total must always be unity.
This unit is, for the sake of brevity, described as RO.
For example the following groups may be set forth:</p>

<p>The reason for the unit rule is that if one formula
is to be compared with another there must be a uniform
basis upon which to work and, furthermore, it makes
no difference whether the silica combines with one,
two, three, or four bases, the chemical action is the
same and, so long as the sum of the bases is kept at
unity, the same amount of silica will be required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>If two glazes be taken as an illustration this will be
made clear:</p>

<tr><td>PbO</td><td>.6</td><td>}</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Both of these formulae are bisilicates and each being
properly fired, will stand, without crazing, on the
same body.</p>

<p>The use of the formula is to give an insight into
the composition of the melted glaze. It takes no account
of volatile ingredients or losses in the fire but
for this very reason it must be translated into the
substances to be weighed before use can be made of it.</p>

<p>Of the ingredients given on pages 142, 143, some
contain but one item of the formula, others contain
several, as in the case of kaolin already cited. Feldspar,
of the variety known as potash feldspar and
named by mineralogists, "orthoclase," is a very useful
ingredient in raw glazes, being, in fact, almost the
only source of potash. The formula, page 142, shows
that a molecule or equivalent of feldspar contains one
molecule of potash K<span class='sub'>2</span>O, one of alumina Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span>, and
six of silica SiO<span class='sub'>2</span>. This fact is taken into account in
calculating the mixture or batch weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Base No. 5 (<a href='#Page_148'>page 148</a>), is as follows:</p>

<p>And this made up into a bisilicate glaze would be:</p>

These figures are, however, given in equivalents
and each must be multiplied by the equivalent

<p>These amounts are weighed out in grams, put upon
the mill with half a pint of water, and ground for
about an hour. When taken off, the jar and porcelain
balls are washed with plenty of water and the washings
saved. The glaze, thus diluted, is strained through a
lawn of 120 mesh and laid aside to settle. The clear
water is then siphoned or poured off and the glaze
is ready for use.</p>

<p>For glazing the glaze should be as thick as cream.
A finger dipped into it should show a white coating
which cannot be shaken off. The pottery to be glazed
should be first soaked in clean water until all absorption
has ceased. It is then wiped dry and plunged
into the glaze bath, or, if the piece be large, the
glaze may be poured over it. The piece is gently
shaken to distribute the glaze evenly and it is then set
aside to dry. Before glazing a piece everything should
be prepared. A stilt or support upon which to set the
wet glazed pottery, and a bowl of water in which to
wash the fingers so as to save all the glaze. It will
be found best to glaze the inside of the piece first.
It should then be well shaken to remove as much glaze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
as possible before beginning the outside. A thick
glaze inside is almost sure to run down to the bottom
where it will form a pool and perhaps burst the piece.</p>

<p>Before firing, the bottom of the pottery should be
carefully trimmed. Any excess of glaze is removed
and the point of contact with the table is sponged
clean. Then, when the piece is set in the kiln the
bottom will not be inclined to stick.</p>


<h3>PART II<br />

<span class='exp'>Matt Glazes</span></h3>

<p>The texture of the matt glaze is always pleasing
and the artist is not content unless at least
some of his work can be finished in this way.</p>

<p>Matt glazes are not underfired glazes nor are they
deadened by acid or sand blast. They are produced
in two ways. First, by an excess of alumina which
is believed to cause the formation of certain compounds
in the glaze, and, second, by an excess of
silica which produces a devitrified surface. It was
mentioned in the last chapter that a glaze free from
alumina will devitrify or become dull. This is undesirable
when a glaze is intended to be brilliant but it
may be controlled and turned to advantage in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
production of a certain type of matt. The successful
preparation of this silica matt is extremely difficult.
In fact, in the studio kiln it is almost impossible.
These small kilns are apt to cool with great rapidity
whereas, in order to produce the silica matt the kiln
must be cooled very slowly, hours and even days of
cooling being sometimes necessary.</p>

<p>The alumina matt is more simple and its texture
is quite satisfactory, being, in the opinion of some,
the more pleasing of the two.</p>

<p>It was mentioned in the last chapter that the best
bright glazes for low temperature work are bisilicates,
having an oxygen ratio of 1:2. The alumina matt has
an oxygen ratio of about 3:4. This is secured in the
following manner. The RO content may consist of
any of the bases used in bright glazes, the proportion
of each being adjusted in accordance with the desired
point of fusion. The alumina content is rather higher
than in a bright glaze and should not fall much below
.3 equivalent, .35 equivalent is even better. The silica
is adjusted in accordance with the following equation:</p>

<p class='formula'>
SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> = 3(3Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span> + 1)&thinsp;/&thinsp;4
</p>

<p>Now if the alumina content be placed at .35 equivalent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
this would work out:</p>

<p class='formula'>
SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> = 3(1.05 + 1)&thinsp;/&thinsp;4
</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p class='formula'>
SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> = 6.15&thinsp;/&thinsp;4 = 1.5375
</p>

<p>But as such a complete fraction is not necessary it
may be stated as 1.54 equivalent. The formula would
therefore be:</p>

<p class='formula'>
RO, Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span> .35, SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> 1.54
</p>

<p>The RO content should not be too fusible. Lead
oxide is desirable up to about .5 equivalent and it is
an advantage to use feldspar so that K<span class='sub'>2</span>O may be
introduced. Calcium oxide is also good but zinc oxide
must be used sparingly as it is apt to suffer if overfired.
The high content of alumina necessitates a good deal
of clay and as this, if used raw, would make the
glaze too plastic and cause it to crack, it is best to
calcine a part of it, thus removing the combined water
and changing the equivalent weight from 258 to 222.
The calculation will then proceed as in the case of
a bright glaze.</p>

</table>

<p>The mix, therefore, is:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>White Lead</td><td class='r'>129 grams</td></tr>
<tr><td>Whiting</td><td class='r'>35 &nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Feldspar</td><td class='r'>83 &nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Calcined Kaolin</td><td class='r'>33 &nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Kaolin</td><td class='r'>13 &nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flint</td><td class='r'>14 &nbsp;"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This will give a silky matt glaze, nearly white, maturing
at about cone 1. If a lower fusing point is
desired the white lead may be increased at the expense
of the whiting or if the glaze prove too fusible
the reverse will correct it. The flint may be omitted
without damage.</p>

<p>The grinding of a matt glaze is of great importance.
It is better to have it too coarse than too fine. Grinding
for one hour on the ball mill should be ample and
if the glaze be then strained through 120 mesh lawn
all coarse particles will be arrested. A glaze that is
too fine will crack and peel off or will curl up in the kiln.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>More than half the success of matt glazes lies in
the using. It is necessary that the coating of glaze
be very thick or the true texture will not be developed.
When the glaze is taken from the mill plenty of water
may be used in order to wash the apparatus clean and
to save all the glaze. This is set aside in a deep bowl
to settle. After some hours the clear water is carefully
drawn off with a siphon.</p>

<p>Half an ounce of gum tragacanth is put to soak
in a quart of clean water. After twelve hours the
gum will have swollen to a jelly-like mass. This is
now worked vigorously with a Dover egg-beater or
in a Christy mixer and again set aside. After another
twelve hours the operation is repeated and the
solution is a clear syrup of the consistency of thin
molasses. A drop or two of carbolic acid or other
germicide should be added to prevent decomposition.
This mucilage should be prepared in advance. To the
glaze batch from which the water has been removed
a tablespoonful of the mucilage is added. If more
of the glaze than the single batch has been weighed
out then more mucilage will be necessary. The mixture
is to be stirred very thoroughly and it will be
found to thicken under the hand. It must be very
much thicker than the bright glaze. In fact, the thicker
it is the better, only that it must flow sufficiently
so that the pottery may be covered with a smooth
coating, avoiding lumps. Matt glazes do not correct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
their own faults in the kiln as bright glazes do. Every
finger mark will show and, consequently, the glazing
must be done with the greatest care. The process is
the same as that described for bright glazes, except
that as much glaze as possible is left on the ware.
No more shaking should be done than will suffice to
secure a smooth coating. It is well to place the pieces
upside down to dry.</p>

<p>For the inside of the pieces a matt glaze may be
used or a thin coat of clear glaze at the pleasure of
the worker. If the latter, care must be taken that
none of the inside glaze is allowed to run over the
edge.</p>

<p>In firing, the pottery is sometimes placed on a stilt
but this is not absolutely necessary. For a support
a flat piece of burned clay may be used and this
should be covered with an infusible wash to prevent
any possibility of sticking. Equal parts of kaolin and
flint make a good wash. The wash is worked up with
water into a slip and applied with an ordinary brush.</p>


<h3>PART III<br />
<span class='exp'>Fritted Glazes</span></h3>

<p>Fritted glazes, like raw glazes, are clear and
brilliant and for most purposes the latter will
suffice. Since, however, the aim of this work is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
give as complete information as may be the fritted
glaze will not be omitted.</p>

<p>A fritt is a melt or compounded glass and the purpose
of it is to permit the use of certain ingredients
which are not available in the raw state. As glazes
are ground in water it is essential that the substances
used be insoluble. This condition would prohibit advantage
being taken of borax, boric acid, and soda
ash, if it were not for the possibility of rendering
these insoluble by the operation of fritting.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a fritted glaze:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>PbO Lead Oxide</td><td>.30</td><td>}</td></tr>
<tr><td>ZnO Zinc Oxide</td><td>.15</td><td>}</td><td>Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span> Alumina .15</td><td>}</td></tr>
<tr><td>CaO Lime</td><td>.25</td><td>}</td><td>B<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span> Boric Acid .40</td><td>}</td><td>SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> Silica 2.65</td></tr>
<tr><td>Na<span class='sub'>2</span>O Soda</td><td>.20</td><td>}</td></tr>
<tr><td>K<span class='sub'>2</span>O Potash</td><td>.10</td><td>}</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This will be produced in accordance with the usual
calculation by the mix:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>White Lead</td><td class='r'>.3 &times; 258</td><td class='r'>=</td><td class='r'>77</td></tr>
<tr><td>Zinc Oxide</td><td class='r'>.15 &times; 81</td><td class='r'>=</td><td class='r'>12</td></tr>
<tr><td>Whiting</td><td class='r'>.25 &times; 100</td><td class='r'>=</td><td class='r'>25</td></tr>
<tr><td>Borax</td><td class='r'>.20 &times; 382</td><td class='r'>=</td><td class='r'>76</td></tr>
<tr><td>Feldspar</td><td class='r'>.10 &times; 557</td><td class='r'>=</td><td class='r'>56</td></tr>
<tr><td>Kaolin</td><td class='r'>.05 &times; 258</td><td class='r'>=</td><td class='r'>13</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flint</td><td class='r'>1.95 &times; 60</td><td class='r'>=</td><td class='r'>117</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The borax contains the required amount of both
soda and boric acid and the potash is supplied by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
feldspar. Borax, being soluble, must be melted with
certain other ingredients into an insoluble glass, thus:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Fritt:</td></tr>
<tr><td>Borax</td><td class='r'>76 x 2 =</td><td class='r'>152</td></tr>
<tr><td>Whiting</td><td class='r'>25 x 2 =</td><td class='r'>50</td></tr>
<tr><td>Feldspar</td><td class='r'>30 x 2 =</td><td class='r'>60</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flint</td><td class='r'>50 x 2 =</td><td class='r'>100</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class='r'>&nbsp;</td><td class='r'>&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class='r'>&nbsp;</td><td class='r'>362</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These ingredients are weighed out in double quantity
to guard against loss in melting and are fused
either in the kiln or in a special furnace. A good
fritting furnace is the No. 15, made by the Buffalo
Dental Manufacturing Company. The charge is put
into a plumbago crucible and when melted is poured
out into water. This breaks up the fritt and renders
it easy to grind. A similar crucible may be used in
the kiln but as the fritt becomes very hard when cold
and a crucible must be broken each time, the furnace
method is better. If the fritt as given prove too sluggish
to pour freely, the feldspar may be omitted, being
added, of course, to the glaze mix. The melted
weight of the fritt must now be calculated.</p>

<p>Borax contains in each equivalent 180 parts water.
Whiting contains in each equivalent 44 parts carbonic
acid. Both water and carbonic acid pass off in the
melting, thus the 76 parts of borax will be reduced
in weight to 40 parts, and the 25 parts of whiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
will be reduced to 14 parts. Spar and flint undergo
no loss. The fritt after melting will therefore be:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Borax</td><td class='r'>40</td></tr>
<tr><td>Whiting</td><td class='r'>14</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spar</td><td class='r'>30</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flint</td><td class='r'>50</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class='r'>&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class='r'>134</td></tr>
</table>

<p>And the final mix for the glaze will be:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Fritt</td><td>134 parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>White Lead</td><td>77&nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Zinc Oxide</td><td>12&nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Feldspar</td><td>26&nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Kaolin</td><td>13&nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flint</td><td>67&nbsp;"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This is ground on the mill as already directed and
is ready for use.</p>

<p>Fritted glazes are better than raw glazes for certain
classes of ware. They are usually whiter and
less easily scratched. They are, moreover, better for
use with underglaze colors and are, as a rule, more
easily melted. It is never necessary to make a fritt
for the preparation of matt glazes.</p>

PART IV<br />
<span class='exp'>Recipes</span></h3>

<p>While the purpose of this work is not so much
to put ready-made materials into the hands of
the craftsman as to enable him to work out his own
plans, it is recognized that there are some workers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
who lack the training and even the patience to do this.
For these, the following recipes are given, but with
the proviso that no recipe can be regarded as perfect
for all conditions. Just as an untrained cook can
spoil a dinner even when surrounded by cookery
books, so the best of recipes will fail when unskillfully
treated. One must be prepared to recognize the faults
which are sure to develop and to correct them in an
intelligent manner. The previous chapters should
therefore be carefully studied, not alone for the information
but because "the joy of the working" depends
greatly upon the knowledge one has of the
operations involved and a modest confidence in one's
own powers.</p>

<h3>
PART V<br />
<span class='exp'>The Defects of Glazes</span></h3>

<p>While it may chance that body and glaze and
fire are so adjusted that faults do not develop,
this state of things is rare. Besides, it is always possible
that an occasional trouble may arise, hence it
will be well to recount a few of the commonest defects
with the method of cure. A cure is not necessarily
specific. There may be a complication of causes but
the remedy indicates the line along which relief will
be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Crazing. Fine cracks appear in the glaze but
do not penetrate the body. There are many causes.
The body may be underfired or overfired. In the former
case the crazing does not always appear at once
and it grows worse upon standing. In the latter case
the glaze is found to be crazed when taken from the
kiln and it does not extend even after long standing.
The glaze may be underfired. In this case the lines
of the crack are broken and irregular, one often
changing its direction without meeting another crack.
In all these cases the remedy is obvious.</p>

<p>Crazing also occurs when both body and glaze are
correctly fired but there is an inherent disagreement in
expansion. In such a case a little flint added either
to the body or to the glaze will tend to cure the trouble
but it must be remembered that the addition of flint
to the glaze is apt to render it less fusible and therefore
while one craze may be cured another may be
caused. The addition of flint to the body is the simplest
remedy.</p>

<p>2. Shivering or peeling. This is the reverse of
crazing and is caused by the glaze being too large
for the body. It almost always appears immediately
the ware is cooled. The symptoms are that edges or
convex surfaces are pushed off and even the ware
itself is shattered. The remedy is to decrease the
flint in either body or glaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Blistering. Glazes, both bright and matt, are apt
to develop blisters at times. These may be yet unbroken
when the kiln is opened or they may have
melted down to a small crater, a ring with a depression
in the center. The cause of this fault is usually
to be found in the body. All clays contain sulphur
and when a clay is aged this develops an acid which
rises to the surface of the ware when dried and causes
a scum. The glaze attacks this sulphate scum and a
gas is generated which boils out and causes the blisters.
If old clay blisters and new clay does not it
may be regarded as certain that this is the cause. A
little barium carbonate added to the clay will help to
effect a cure. About one per cent. is usually enough.
Clay so treated, however, must not be used in plaster
molds as the barium attacks the plaster. If the cause
be not found in the clay it may exist in the glaze itself.
Some glaze ingredients contain impurities in the form
of sulphates and these will cause blisters.</p>

<p>4. The glaze flows, leaving bare places. It is too
fluid, add a little clay and flint.</p>

<p>5. A matt glaze burns to a bright surface. Matt
glazes must be used in a very thick coat. If too thin
they will inevitably brighten. The fire may be too
high. The fire may be "reducing," that is, with insufficient
air.</p>

<p>6. The glaze crawls or rolls up in lumps. Notice
whether the glaze is cracked before burning. If so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
it will surely crawl. Too fine grinding is usually the
cause of this trouble. Too much clay in the glaze
may cause it, or a too porous body. A body which is
underfired will almost certainly cause the glaze to
crawl.</p>

<p>7. Pinholes appear in the glaze when cool. Too
rapid cooling is the cause.</p>

<h3>
PART VI<br />
<span class='exp'>Alkaline Glazes</span>
</h3>

<p>The glory of the Persian and Egyptian blue is
too alluring for potters to withstand. Though
the pursuit of this glory leads one into all kinds of
disasters and failures, the avenues of research that
it opens add unending fascination to the study. Even
one beautiful glowing pot out of twenty or more efforts
is a stimulating achievement though it should
not be thought that this is the usual proportion.</p>

<p>It is a continual source of astonishment that with
a slight variation of glaze formula a positive green
will swim into a vibrating blue. The addition or substitution
of one substance or another in the glaze mix
may be the key to an unexpected transformation and
may give the potter a new palette of color.</p>

<p>The clay body has a very positive effect on alkaline
glaze both in its composition and its color. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
especially true under a transparent glaze where the
effect is considerable since the color of the glaze would
be modified by the red or buff clay showing through.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the object of the potter is to obtain
a brilliant "Persian" blue, a white clay body must be
composed or a white <i>engobe</i> applied over the buff or
red clay to hide the color.</p>

<p>The Persians and Egyptians used a coarse, sandy
body high in silica and covered the roughness of the
clay with a fine white <i>engobe</i> on which they painted
their decorations in various colors. The whole was
finally covered with the transparent alkaline glaze.</p>

<p>While the effect of colored clay under opaque glaze
is less pronounced, it still makes sufficient difference
to be considered.</p>

<p>The word <i>engobe</i> is French and refers to a thin
coating of clay, also called a slip, laid over a colored
body to change the color or over a coarse body to
give a finer texture.</p>

<p>The <i>engobe</i> is usually composed of china clay, flint,
and feldspar much as a white earthenware body is
constituted but with a larger content of flint. Ball
clay may also be used but the color is not so white.</p>

<p>The mixture of porcelain given on page forty will
make an <i>engobe</i> suitable for many clay bodies. If it
should crack on drying more flint should be added.</p>

<p>An <i>engobe</i> must, of course, be put upon the unburned
or green clay ware and this should be leather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
hard, not dry. The body with the <i>engobe</i> may be
burned before glazing or the glaze may be put upon
the unburned ware and the whole subjected to one
fire only.</p>

<p>The ingredients in alkaline glazes are soda-ash,
whiting, feldspar, flint and oxide of tin. The following
is an example of a fritted glaze:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Na<span class='sub'>2</span>O</td><td>.60</td><td>}</td></tr>
<tr><td>K<span class='sub'>2</span>O</td><td>.10</td><td>} Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span> .10</td><td>SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> 1.30</td></tr>
<tr><td>CaO</td><td>.30</td><td>}</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Soda Ash</td><td>64</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Whiting</td><td>30</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Feldspar</td><td>56</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Flint</td><td>42</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The entire batch is fritted and ground in a ball
mill with the usual amount of water for fritt grinding,
adding a tablespoonful of gum tragacanth mucilage
to the batch after it is sieved. The glaze should be
the consistency of heavy cream when used.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use an alkaline glaze in the
raw or unfritted state. This necessitates grinding by
hand in a mortar, but great care must be taken to mix
the dry ingredients thoroughly before adding water
and to stir the glaze constantly while pouring in the
water, otherwise the soda-ash will cake and harden
and be very difficult to break up. A batch of glaze
can be ground by hand in fifteen or twenty minutes
if done vigorously. It is then put through a 120-mesh
sieve. The consistency is of importance. If too much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
water has been added and the glaze has become thin,
it cannot be used successfully and should be discarded.
Unfritted alkaline glaze does not keep well when moist
but the ingredients can be ground dry and kept ready
to be moistened as needed.</p>

<p>The following is an example of an unfritted alkaline
glaze:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Na<span class='sub'>2</span>O</td><td>.59</td><td>}</td></tr>
<tr><td>CaO</td><td>.21</td><td>}</td><td>Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span> .20</td><td>SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> 1.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>K<span class='sub'>2</span>O</td><td>.20</td><td>}</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Soda Ash</td><td class='r'>62</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Whiting</td><td class='r'>21</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Feldspar</td><td class='r'>111</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Flint</td><td class='r'>24</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For color add the following oxides to a batch.</p>

<p>1. Egyptian blue, opaque&mdash;from 5 to 8 grams of
black oxide of copper&mdash;16 grams of oxide of tin.</p>

<p>2. Persian blue, opaque&mdash;from 8 to 10 grams of
black oxide of copper&mdash;16 grams of oxide of tin.</p>

<p>3. Sapphire blue&mdash;1 gram black oxide of cobalt.</p>

<p>4. Aubergine&mdash;9 grams black oxide of manganese.</p>

<p>The clear glaze without any coloring oxide can be
used over any of the colored glazes. This is sometimes
necessary when the colored glaze contains such
a large proportion of coloring oxide as to show black
on the surface.</p>

<p>The application of alkaline glaze is very important.
Any of the three methods of pouring, dipping, and
brushing can be employed. Brushing seems to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the best results but the glaze must be put on thick, in
two or three coats, to give quality.</p>

<p>The firing is interesting and important because of
the varied effects it develops from the same formula.
The range of temperature is great, varying from cone
.05 to 1, developing the alkaline glaze according to
the result desired. If the biscuit is soft fired the color
will be more intense; if hard fired, the color will be
much lighter in value with a high sheen on the surface.
An unfritted alkaline glaze burned to .05 develops a
soft matt finish.</p>

<p>Where the color of a transparent Persian blue
comes out olive green, too little glaze has been used on
the piece or the buff of the clay has modified the
color. Bubbles mean undeveloped glaze or sulphur in
the clay or fuel. Black scum shows an excess of copper
in the batch, or reduction in the fire. Sand paper
surface proves too low firing or too thin a glaze.</p>

<p>If one desires to reproduce the underglaze Persian
decoration the black outlines may be drawn with a
black underglaze color mixed with clay. A little mucilage
must be added to secure smooth working. The
turquoise blue is copper oxide, the dark blue cobalt,
and the purple manganese. The oxides must be diluted
with white clay and used rather thin. The Rhodian
red is a finely ground red burning clay mixed with
a little flint. This red must be laid on quite thickly.
It will probably be found necessary to fire the painted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
decoration to about cone .03 before glazing. The glaze
may be either quite clear or slightly tinted. Another
effect may be produced by using the black outline
alone under a peacock blue or turquoise glaze.</p>

<p>A great many modifications and additions to this
subject will suggest themselves to the potter as he
works, and a continual study of the masterpieces of
the Persians in the museums will prove the greatest
inspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_XVI'>
CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class='exp'>Decoration</span>
</h2>

<p>The necessity for some kind of decoration upon
the clay will always be a point of difference
amongst artists. Some prefer the simple form with a
glaze treatment only, others consider that the surface
should be broken up by design. The question will
not be debated here. The aim of this hand-book is
instruction and the individuality of the worker is to
be encouraged. Directions for executing the different
treatments do not imply that these elaborations are
advocated. That must be left to the inspiration of the
worker.</p>

<p>Decorations may be applied upon the soft clay by
incising, inlaying and embossing; upon the dry clay
or upon the burned pottery in color under the glaze
or with no glaze at all; in the glaze by the use of
colors or colored glazes; or over the glaze with colors
and enamels. Each of these methods possesses special
features. Each has its own possibilities and limitations
and these should be mastered by the craftsman.</p>

<p>As in the production of form a well-planned design
should be prepared. The first sketch should be made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
on paper or on a slab of clay but the fitting and final
arrangement are best made on the piece itself.</p>

<p>Incising consists in the excavation of a shallow
trench or trough on the surface of the clay. The vase
or jar having been finished should be kept in a damp
place so that the clay does not dry out completely.
The design may be made in India ink with a brush.
A steel tool with a narrow chisel end is used for cutting
and care must be taken that the clay is in such
a condition of moisture as will admit of a clean
trench being dug without any rough or broken edges.
The bottom of the trench need not be very smooth
but the edges should be sharp and the lines well defined.
At the same time a mechanical hardness of
finish is to be avoided. The plastic nature of the clay
should be kept in mind and every surface, though
decided in character, should be soft and expressive.
This result can be secured by working over the cutting
with a moist camel-hair brush. The work must not be
mopped so as to leave a woolly effect, but a little sympathetic
penciling will remove the hard lines of the tool.</p>

<p>There are two possible developments of incised
work. The details of the design may be excavated or
the background may be cut out leaving the drawing
in relief.</p>

<p>In modeling embossments the piece should be a
little softer than for incising. It is important that in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
any clay work attached to a clay body the same amount
of moisture should be present in both parts. This is
not entirely possible in modeling upon forms which
have already been shaped, for if the form be as soft
as modeling clay it will not bear to be handled, while
if the clay were as hard as the form it could not be
worked. A compromise is therefore necessary. The
vase must be kept as soft as possible consistent with
holding its shape and the clay must be as stiff as the
working will allow.</p>

<p>As little water as possible should be used and the
modeling should not be brought to its full height at
once. If the clay be laid on little by little there is
much less chance of cracking. Low relief is sometimes
produced by painting in slip but here even more
care is necessary. The slip should be laid on with a
brush in thin coats, each coat being allowed to stiffen
before another is applied and the whole work being
kept moist.</p>

<p>An atomizer with clean water is useful in this regard.
The work, being kept on a whirler or turntable,
is sprayed now and then with water and thus
prevented from becoming too hard.</p>

<p>When the slip work has been raised to the desired
height the surface is tooled over so as to remove the
brush marks. This is the method which has been
brought to such perfection by the French artists and
by them named <i>p&acirc;te-sur-p&acirc;te</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Modeled work is generally carried out in the same
clay as that of which the form is made and depends
upon high relief for its effect. Slip painting is usually
done in a different color and if a light-colored
slip be used upon a dark clay, the latter is partially
seen through the coating in the thinnest places. This
fact is made use of to accentuate the shadow effects.</p>

<p>In using one clay over another great care must be
taken to insure that the fire shrinkage is the same.
The white body already given, or indeed, any light
colored clay, may be tinted by the addition of under-glaze
colors. The dry color, if sifted very fine, may
be added to the plastic clay by thorough kneading
and wedging but it is better to work up the clay into
a slip and to stir in the color. The tinted slip is then
lawned two or three times and dried out on plaster or
used in the slip state as the case may be.</p>

<p>A trial should be made before any important work
is undertaken, both to see that the color is right and
to discover any discrepancy in shrinkage. If a clay
shrinks too much, a little ground flint may be added.
If it shrinks too little, a little ball clay will correct it.
The tint produced by the color is apt to darken in the
kiln but the general hue will be similar to that of the
color used.</p>

<p>For some classes of work a native red clay gives
admirable results. It may be lightened by the use
of kaolin and flint and darkened by adding burnt umber.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
These colors are more satisfactory than greens
and blues in clay because the brown and red tones
are natural, the others are artificial.</p>

<p>If a good buff-burning clay be available, it forms
the best possible foundation for color work. Burnt
umber will darken it and red clay may be mixed with
it, always having regard to the matter of shrinkage
already mentioned.</p>

<p>Very pleasing effects may be produced by inlaying
one clay with another. The pattern or design is first
cut out as described under incising and then the second
clay is pressed, morsel by morsel, into the excavation.
The surface is cleaned off level with the
body of the piece and the whole may be either polished
or glazed.</p>

<p>A plastic clay can be polished when leather hard
and the finish will remain after firing. Any tool of
steel, boxwood or ivory will do the work but a good
supply of patience is needed so that the whole surface
may be uniformly treated.</p>

<p>For color decoration upon the pottery, ordinary underglaze
colors are used, either upon the unburned
clay or upon the burned ware commonly called biscuit.
For use upon the clay, the colors should be mixed in
water, using a little molasses, sugar, glycerine or gum
arabic to make the color flow easily from the brush.
Before burning, a little glaze should be sprayed over
the work with an atomizer. Any ordinary fusible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
glaze will do. It is diluted with a good deal of water
as only the very thinnest coat is necessary. The spray
should not be held long in one place or the water will
flow and smear the color. If the piece be turned slowly
around the clay will absorb the water as it is applied.
If this spraying be not done the colors will be
apt to rub off after burning. Under-glaze colors are
not fusible and hence they come from the fire as dry powders.</p>

<p>The work on the biscuit is much the same except
that turpentine and fat oil constitute a better working
medium. When dry the spray should be applied as before.</p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_XVII'>
CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class='exp'>The Fire</span>
</h2>

<p>Kilns and burning form the pivot upon which
the art of the potter turns. M. Doat has said,
"A potter can no more express himself without his
kiln than can a violinist without his violin," and yet
there are some who try to make out by sending their
work to some nearby pottery to be burned. Let it be
at once understood that he who finds it impossible to
procure and manage a kiln had best take to some other craft.</p>

<p>Kilns are of two types, open and muffle. In the
open kiln the flames pass through the firing chamber
and the ware may be exposed to their action, as in
stoneware and brick; or it may be enclosed in the
fire-clay cases, called saggers, as in the many forms
of pottery, dishes or faience. The muffle kiln is a
closed chamber which is surrounded by flames but
which is not entered by them. These kilns are used
in the manufacture of terra cotta and heavy enamel
wares, and the portable kilns made for studio use are
of this type.</p>

<p>There are certain advantages to be gained in the
use of either type of kiln but inasmuch as the open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
kiln involves the use of saggers and as, moreover, it
must be properly constructed of fire-brick by a skilled
mason, it will be best to consider only the portable
studio kiln.<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_M' id='FNanchor_M' href='#Footnote_M'>[M]</a></p>

<p>It must not be expected that any kiln will give
perfect satisfaction. Neither built kiln nor portable
kiln will do this, but either may be relied upon to do
excellent work in the hands of those who will take
trouble. A kiln of the proper size having been purchased,
it must be carefully installed. A good chimney
is an absolute necessity and if one can be built
on purpose it will be best. It should be at least twenty-five
feet high with the bottom lined with fire-brick
to a height of six or eight feet. The portable kiln
is set on iron legs which raise it about one foot from
the floor. This is not enough for easy work and a
platform of brick or stone, ten inches high, should
be prepared. This will greatly simplify the observation
and management of the burners which are beneath
the kiln, and if it should make the inside of the
muffle hard to reach, it is easier to stand on a box
to attend to the kiln than it is to go on one's knees
to the burner.</p>

<p>The kiln room should have a cement floor and
should be both well drained and well ventilated. At
the window there should be a stout bench where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
work of preparation may be done and at a convenient
spot there should be shelves for stilts, cones, wash,
stopping and all the minor accessories of burning. If
there is room for a barrel of oil it will be a convenience,
and if the room be fire-proof the insurance company
will not object.</p>

<p>The kiln having arrived it is mounted on the platform
and the asbestos-lined pipe is securely connected
with the chimney. The inside of the muffle is
examined with care to see that no part has been jarred
in transit. The reservoir cans are filled with oil
and a slow fire is started. This should be allowed to
burn very gently for an hour or two in order to thoroughly
dry out and season the kiln. It is a good plan
to make up a wash of equal parts of kaolin and flint
and to brush this all over the inside of the kiln. It
should not be put on so thick as to shell off from
the walls but at the bottom a good coating may be laid.
This protects the walls of the kiln from the attacks
of glaze and will make them last longer.</p>

<p>In order to fill the kiln economically a number of
props and bats must be provided. Some of these are
sent out with the kiln but one is always needing odd
sizes and extra pieces. The props are simply legs of
burned clay; they are of any height desired and
should be thick enough to stand alone. The bats are
slabs of burned clay and they rest on the props to
form shelves. The bats must be thick enough to bear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the weight of any pieces which they may be called
upon to support, but they need not be very large as
two or more may be used to bridge the width and
length of the kiln. Bats and props are best made of
sagger clay to which has been added about one-third
of crushed fire-brick. Broken bats serve well for this
after the first supply has been secured. This crushed
burned clay, called grog, has a very important influence
upon wares which have to be heated again and
again. The size used should be about what will pass
through a 16-mesh sieve, and if the dust be sifted
out through a 48-mesh sieve, the resulting ware will
be stronger. That is, only the grog which passes a
16 sieve but lies upon a 48 sieve should be used.</p>

<p>The relative proportions of clay and grog in the
mix will depend somewhat upon the nature of the
clay. Three parts of clay to two of grog by measure
will be about right.</p>

<p>The first charging of the kiln should be with pieces
of no great importance. The temperature in different
parts must be carefully ascertained. In order to do
this a number of pyrometric cones<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_N' id='FNanchor_N' href='#Footnote_N'>[N]</a> are prepared
in groups of three.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the work is intended to be
carried out at a temperature of Cone No. 01. The
numbers run both ways from this. The higher or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
less fusible cones are, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., up to 36, and the
more fusible numbers are 02, 03, etc., down to 022.
If the firing is to be to Cone 01, numbers 02, 01 and
1 are selected and set upright in a small strip of soft
clay. Eight or ten of these groups of three cones
are to be prepared for the first firing, so as to test
the kiln, one group is placed in each corner, at the
bottom, and another in each corner on a shelf, which
is arranged opposite the spy-hole in the door. In the
middle of this, where it can be well seen through the
hole, one of the groups of cones is placed. They
must be set so that all three cones are visible as the
kiln is being fired.</p>

<p>The kiln is now filled up on both levels with pieces
of pottery. To burn an empty kiln is not a reliable
test. On the first occasion the fire should be started
in the morning because no one can tell just how long
the burn will take. When this time is ascertained it
is best to start the fire so that the kiln will be finished
by early evening. The cooling then takes place at
night and there is no temptation to open the door too soon.</p>

<p>The fire is started slowly and the flow of oil is
gradually increased as the muffle begins to glow. The
work here needs practice, nerve and judgment. A
good deal of smoke will be seen at the chimney at
first but this should disappear as the kiln grows red.
If the fire be urged too strongly at the beginning fuel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
will be consumed to no purpose, the only result being
the choking of the flues with carbon. As the red
becomes visible through the spy-hole, more oil may
be supplied, but notice must be taken that the smoke
at the chimney does not increase. The ideal firing
is where there is no smoke but this cannot be reached
until the kiln is hot enough to cause the smoke to burn.</p>

<p>Persons who have burned kilns for overglaze work
will find the method of burning pottery very different.
Instead of a fire brought as rapidly as possible to the
finishing point, there must now be a slow soaking
burn in which the heat shall have time to saturate
the ware.</p>

<p>The cones in front of the spy-hole must be observed
from time to time and presently as the kiln reaches a
bright cherry red, number 02 will begin to bend at
the tip and will gradually arch over until the point
touches the shelf upon which the cones stand. By
this time number 01 will have begun to bend and
when the point of this has touched the shelf, the firing
is over and the oil is shut off.</p>

<p>It requires some resolution to leave a kiln until
morning but it is conducive to early rising anyway.
The kiln need not be quite cold but it will help the
kiln itself to wear better and the pottery will be better
if nothing is done until everything can be handled
without gloves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The cones are now taken out and a diagram is
made of each level with the bend of each cone accurately
drawn. This diagram should be mounted and
hung on the wall for reference. It is not well to trust
to memory. It will probably be found, in the type of
kiln we are discussing, that the cones on the bottom
have bent further than those on the shelf. That is,
the bottom is somewhat the hotter.</p>

<p>The variation in the kiln is not necessarily a disadvantage.
It may be utilized in burning wares of different
kinds. For example, if the bottom prove much
the hotter, the biscuit ware may be placed below and
the glazed pieces on the shelf. In such case the shelf
itself should be washed with a good coating of clay
and flint in order to protect it from casual drops of glaze.</p>

<p>If a number of small pieces are being made, more
than one shelf should be set up. The legs may be
just a little taller than the tallest of the small pieces,
but the art of placing or filling a kiln economically
consists in making selection of pieces which fit well
together both as regards height and shape. Thus,
pieces which are large at the base may be dovetailed
in with others of which the base is smaller than the
upper part. In the case of clay ware the pieces may
be set close together or even piled one upon another.
There is no danger of sticking unless the ware is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
burned to complete vitrification. The glazed pieces
must not, of course, touch each other.</p>

<p>It will be seen, from these instructions, that there
should be a good assortment of wares from which to
select. Economical firing cannot be managed if a
burn be attempted whenever a piece is ready, and
patience must be exercised so as to fill the kiln to
advantage.</p>

<p>It is important that anyone attempting to burn a
kiln should have some understanding of the phenomena
of combustion. Many things occur in the firing
which, without such an understanding, are not easily
explained but which become perfectly clear when considered
in the light of simple chemical science.</p>

<p>Combustion means oxidation or a combination between
the elements of the fuel, principally carbon and
hydrogen, and the oxygen of the air. This combination
is a chemical action and as it proceeds heat is
liberated. With a given amount of a specific fuel and
a given amount of air there is always the same amount
of heat, but the rate at which this heat is given off
varies with the time occupied in the operation. Heat
may be generated slowly which means a low temperature,
or the same volume of heat may be generated
rapidly, occupying a much shorter time and developing
a higher temperature. From these statements it
will be seen that there is a difference between heat
and temperature; heat means volume, temperature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
means intensity. Thus the temperature derivable
from a given amount of fuel depends upon the rapidity
with which it is burned.</p>

<p>Combustion may be either complete or incomplete.
In the former case enough air is supplied to oxidize
all the fuel with, usually, some excess. The contents
of the kiln are then bathed in the heated oxygen and
the condition of the burning is called oxidizing.
When the combustion is incomplete, on the other
hand, there is a deficiency of oxygen. The kiln is
charged with hot carbonaceous gases and smoke, and
these, being hungry for oxygen, will abstract it from
any substance which may be present. This condition
is called reducing because the compounds which exist
in clay or glaze are deprived of oxygen and thus reduced
to a lower state of oxidation.</p>

<p>In burning a kiln one should be able to produce
either of these conditions at will because there are
certain wares which require one or the other in order
to secure the best results. To put the matter in a
nutshell, oxidizing conditions are induced by a strong
draft and open flues, reducing conditions are obtained
by closing the air inlets and using a liberal amount
of fuel.</p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_XVIII'>
CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class='exp'>High-Temperature Wares</span>
</h2>

<p>The subject of "Grand Feu Ceramics" has been
so ably developed by M. Taxile Doat in his
admirable treatise<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_P' id='FNanchor_P' href='#Footnote_P'>[P]</a> that it will be unnecessary to go
deeply into the matter, but in order that the reader
may be aware of what is involved, some description
of the technique will be given.</p>

<p>Hard-fired wares are divided into two classes, porcelain
and stoneware. The latter is called by the
French, "Gr&egrave;s," an abbreviation of the name "Gr&egrave;s
de Flandres," the stoneware made in the low countries
in the sixteenth century. Both these wares are,
technically, once fired, that is, the body and glaze
come to maturity at one and the same burning. The
biscuit ware is often given a low burn at first in order
to facilitate handling, but this leaves the body very
porous and is in no sense a maturing fire. The glaze
is laid upon this porous ware, or upon the unburned
clay if preferred, and then comes the high fire or
"Grand Feu" of the French.</p>

<p>A mix for a porcelain body has already been given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
but if the ceramist means seriously to attack the porcelain
problem he will have to do some experimental
work for himself. The Georgia kaolin mentioned in
the recipe on page 40 is a good, plastic clay but it is
slightly off color. It may be necessary to improve
the color by the use, in part, of another kaolin such
as the Harris clay from North Carolina.<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_Q' id='FNanchor_Q' href='#Footnote_Q'>[Q]</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, in the preparation of a fine porcelain
it is necessary to grind the whole mix upon a mill.
The mill used for glaze grinding will answer every
purpose and care must be taken that the grinding,
while carried far enough, be not too long continued.
A certain amount of fine grit in the body mass is
necessary but only by constant practice can the right
point be reached. In making these experiments each
step should be faithfully noted in a handy book. The
amount of water to a given weight of clay and the
duration of the grinding should be accurately observed
and written down. It is most unwise to trust to memory.</p>

<p>The process of casting may be used for porcelain
as already described, but the very best of workmanship
is necessary. The hard fire to which the porcelain
is subjected reveals every error which has occurred
in the making. The same thing applies to
wheel work. Not only is great skill required in order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to shape the tender porcelain clay on the wheel but
the very essence of the porcelain is its lightness, to
produce which by craftsmanship a long and arduous
course of training must be endured.</p>

<p>Stoneware is free from many of these difficulties
and, consequently one who attempts the conquest of
high-temperature wares is advised to begin with this.
Stoneware clay need not be a mixture. There are
many clays which can be used for the manufacture of
gr&egrave;s with no more preparation than that laid down
for common clays.<a class='fnanchor' name='FNanchor_R' id='FNanchor_R' href='#Footnote_R'>[R]</a> It sometimes happens that a clay
will need the addition of a small quantity of flint or
spar but this does not amount to a difficulty.</p>

<p>Stoneware does not present the same manufacturing
difficulties as are found in porcelain. The clay is
quite plastic and can be easily shaped on the wheel;
casting is scarcely a suitable process for this ware.
The essence of stoneware is strength and virility, just
as that of porcelain is lightness and grace. Each
ware has forms suited to itself and it is a mistake to
depart from these essential characteristics.</p>

<p>After shaping and drying the technical manipulation
of both wares proceeds along the usual lines.
The first fire is at a very low temperature. The melting
point of silver (cone 010) is enough in nearly
every case. This leaves the ware in a soft and porous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
condition but hard enough to resist the action of
water. The process of glazing has already been described
but the composition of the proper glazes differs
from that of low temperature glazes.</p>

<p>Porcelain is always burned in a reducing fire; stoneware
may be burned either reducing or oxidizing.
The temperature at which the glaze is burned is very
high, it must be, in fact, the maturing point of the
body itself.</p>

<p>The simplest form of porcelain glaze is that represented
by the formula&mdash;</p>

<table>
<tr><td>K<span class='sub'>2</span>O</td><td>.3</td><td>}</td></tr>
<tr><td>CaO</td><td>.7</td><td>}</td><td>Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span> .5</td><td>SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> 4.0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Which is carried out in the following mixture:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Feldspar</td><td class='r'>167</td></tr>
<tr><td>Whiting</td><td class='r'>70</td></tr>
<tr><td>Kaolin</td><td class='r'>52</td></tr>
<tr><td>Flint</td><td class='r'>108</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class='r'>&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The glaze is ground for use.</p>

<p>The same glaze will also serve for stoneware but
it will burn to a brilliant surface whereas stoneware
is better when finished with a matt texture.</p>

<p>The following is a stoneware matt glaze:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>K<span class='sub'>2</span>O</td><td>.3</td><td>}</td></tr>
<tr><td>CaO</td><td>.7</td><td>}</td><td>Al<span class='sub'>2</span>O<span class='sub'>3</span> .7</td><td>SiO<span class='sub'>2</span> 2.6</td></tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Of which formula the mixture is&mdash;</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Feldspar</td><td class='r'>167</td></tr>
<tr><td>Whiting</td><td class='r'>70</td></tr>
<tr><td>Calcined Kaolin</td><td class='r'>66</td></tr>
<tr><td>Raw Kaolin</td><td class='r'>26</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class='r'>&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The porcelain glaze is at its best when uncolored.
The matt glaze will be more interesting when used as
a colored coating.</p>

<p>The following are a few suggestions for colored
matt stoneware glazes. To the glaze batch, 329 parts, add:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>For blue:</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Cobalt Oxide</td><td class='r'>2</td><td>parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Nickel Oxide</td><td class='r'>1</td><td>part</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Ground Rutile</td><td class='r'>10</td><td>parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>For brown:</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Iron Oxide</td><td class='r'>6</td><td>parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Nickel Oxide</td><td class='r'>3</td><td>parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Ground Rutile</td><td class='r'>10</td><td>parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>For green:</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Chrome Oxide</td><td class='r'>2</td><td>parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Cobalt Oxide</td><td class='r'>1</td><td>part</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Iron Oxide</td><td class='r'>4</td><td>parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>For dark red:</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Chrome Oxide</td><td class='r'>2</td><td>parts</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Zinc Oxide</td><td class='r'>6</td><td>parts</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Rutile has not before been mentioned. It is a crude
oxide of titanium and is exceedingly useful in high
temperature work for producing odd, mossy and crystalline
effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>These mixtures make no pretense to be complete,
they are given as suggestions only because if the
artist-potter is to be successful he must be prepared
to compound glazes which are the expression of his
own individuality.</p>

<p>For burning high-temperature wares the kilns already
described may be used but upon purchasing it
should be stipulated that the kiln is to stand burning
up to cone 11 or 12. Successful porcelain can be
made at cone 10 but better results are secured at
cone 12, though, of course, the wear upon the kiln
is proportionately greater. Stoneware requires a burn
of about cone 9, higher or lower according to the
clay used but fine results must not be expected below
cone 7 nor is it necessary to go higher than cone 10.</p>

<h2 id='CHAPTER_XIX'>
CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class='exp'>Clay-working for Children</span>
</h2>

<p>One of the modern developments of clay-working
is the use of it in elementary and high schools
as a branch of manual training. In this, clay meets
the most exacting needs of the work for it affords a
perfect means of self-expression. Other arts interpose
between the pupil and his material a series of
tools or appliances, more or less elaborate, which constitute
a barrier to the personal touch. Clay presents
no such obstacles. The ten fingers are all the tools
that are necessary at the beginning and, consequently,
the personal equation in clay-working is remarkably high.</p>

<p>In the kindergarten the children take to clay work
as little ducks to water and the interest is never lost.
In this way, clay, instead of adding to the labors of
a teacher already overburdened by a plethora of subjects,
constitutes a real relief. The work is so interesting
that it moves along of itself and all that is
needed is intelligent direction.</p>

<p>It is, of course, necessary that anyone attempting
to teach clay-working to children should have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
knowledge of methods and principles. The essence of
power, especially in teaching, is reserve, but there is
great danger in expecting too much from small heads
and hands. In the early exercises the skill of the
teacher should even be employed to conceal her art.
It is a mistake to place before elementary pupils work
which is far beyond their reach. Let the teacher make
before the class something which they themselves can
do if they try and they will be encouraged to greater effort.</p>

<p>A small cylinder is a suitable beginning exercise for
several reasons. The form is definite and the result
may therefore be easily criticized by the children
themselves, the size of the piece may be readily adapted
to the small fingers and the simplicity of line enables
the attention to be concentrated upon the manipulation
of the clay.</p>

<p>This cylindrical form may be made more interesting
by the addition of little feet or handles; by a simple
line border incised along the upper edge; or by dividing
the surface into well-spaced panels. The planning
of the cylinder itself is a good exercise in rectangle
proportion.</p>

<p>In order to enable the pupils to turn their work
from side to side each one should be provided with a
piece of paper or cardboard the size of the base of
the pottery. The building is started upon this and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
managed in such a way, the clay does not stick to the
table.</p>

<p>When the idea of pottery building, either by coils
or by pieces welded together, has been grasped, the
children should be taught to think in the solid. There
is almost always a difficulty in making children see
that an outline drawing and a solid form may be alike
in meaning. The teacher should draw upon the blackboard
a simple jar in elevation, the plan, of course,
will be a circle. The same thing is then made in clay
by both teacher and children and the results are compared
with the drawing. This will lead to the designing
of the forms in outline by the children themselves.
These designs should be made the exact size of the
proposed pottery and if the outline be carefully cut
out the line of the paper may be applied to the work
as a template. By such means the children are led
to produce accurate lines in the clay and control over
the material is secured.</p>

<p>There is always a temptation, when the clay sags or
loses shape, to diverge from the original idea and to
allow the material to shape itself. This inevitably
leads to slovenly work and should be resisted from
the first. The paper template helps to correct such an
impulse and the pupil presently finds that the clay
can be successfully controlled if enough trouble be
taken. There is much interest too in the cutting of
pottery forms from folded paper. A number of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
forms may be pinned on a screen and the children led
to select the best in line and proportion. Too much
emphasis cannot be laid on the necessity for showing
the children fine examples of pottery, both ancient and
modern. The more primitive types, where the form
and the decoration are so perfectly adapted to each
other and to the material, are full of inspiration for
the child potter as well as for the adult. When one
is fortunate enough to be near a museum, many
illustrations will be found, but good photographs or
drawings are available for almost everyone. Constant
comparison and the exercise of choice will lead to a
development of taste, which must affect the child
whether he later becomes a producer or a consumer.</p>

<p>A flower holder is a good problem. It is a solid
piece of clay two or three inches in diameter and an
inch thick. This may be round or square in form and
may have simple modeled decoration added to it.
Quarter inch holes are pierced at regular intervals,
in fact, they themselves should form part of the design.
For the older children a shallow bowl of good
line with a flower holder to fit is an interesting problem.
Other good problems, which may be made more
or less difficult according to the grade in which they
are given, are rose jars, bread and milk bowls, incense
burners, cylindrical jars, square fern dishes, candlesticks
and small lamp bases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>When working out decoration for pottery forms, it
is well to have the children make their designs with
the modeling tool upon the clay itself. If a piece of
soft clay be rolled out flat upon the table it affords the
best possible medium for making clay designs. The
pupil is at once put in touch with the possibilities and
limitations of the material. A drawing made upon
paper may have to be entirely changed before it is
suitable for use on clay. The soft surface can be
smoothed over as often as necessary and a new sketch
made until a design is approved for application to the
pottery itself. In the chapter on decoration will be
found suggestions for clay treatment.</p>

<p>The making of tiles affords an interesting application
of the principles of design, but the instructions
in the chapter on tile should be followed in order to
insure a workman-like product. If it is possible to
use plaster, the making of a decorated tile from which
a mold can be made and other tiles pressed is a good
problem. Animal forms lend themselves to the decoration
of such tiles and are always interesting to children.</p>

<p>While these chapters are especially devoted to ceramics
in the sense of burned and glazed pottery a
few words upon modeling as related to school work
may be added here. Imitative modeling from cast or
copy with its development of animal and figure modeling,
both from life and from memory, is valuable in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the acquirement of the power of manipulation and
control as well as in the cultivation of observation,
imagination and memory. In the best regulated schools
the work of the grades is often correlated in the study
of some phase of human life. Facts are grouped
around some epoch or event in history or some country
or clime in geography. The children take up the
clay while their minds are full of the current subject
and nothing more natural than that they should illustrate
the story by models.</p>

<p>Such work is to be thoroughly commended as truly
educational, though it does not fall strictly within the
field of pottery and a few suggestions may therefore
be in order.</p>

<p>The modeling of animals or people for the sand
table is full of interest for the younger children. Such
stories as "The Three Bears," "Chicken Little" and
"The Little Red Hen" immediately suggest themselves.
For children of about the fourth grade
"Alice in Wonderland" offers a most fascinating array
of models. "The White Rabbit," "The Duchess,"
"The Mock Turtle," "The Mad Hatter," grotesques of
all sorts, seem a natural outcome of this illustration
work and the wise teacher will see the possibility for
developing the imagination in the modeling of mythical
creatures, such as dragons and gnomes, and in the
personification of the elements. There is also an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
unlimited fund of material in the tales of knighthood
and of fairyland.</p>

<p>With the older children, simple principles of design
and composition should be suggested. A paper weight
is an interesting problem demanding the adaptation of
form to space.</p>

<p>Many of these things may be modeled in clay, dried
and painted with water color or one of the patent
modeling clays which set like cement may be used.
If no supports have been left in the model it may be
fired when thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>Some of the best projects for sand table work involving
modeling are Eskimo Life, Indian Life, Farm
Life, The Circus, and Fairy Tales. Generally a suggestion
is all that is necessary to call forth the most
original conceptions and once started the children will
soon far outstrip the teacher.</p>
